Areas to Improve:
Combat Mechanics:

Armor and Equipment:

Youâ€™ve detailed a good system for armor (No Armor, Lightly Armored, Armored, Heavily Armored) with narrative pros and cons. However, you could add more about how this affects different types of combat encounters.
Suggestion: Introduce a small section on how armor affects specific narrative outcomes, such as making noise while sneaking, attracting attention, or exhausting the wearer in survival settings. This adds more depth without creating complex stat-based rules.
Survival Mechanics:

These mechanics are critical to maintaining realism, but the level of detail might need balancing with ease of play.
Suggestion: Simplify long-term survival tracking by creating easy-to-reference tables for food and water needs or shelter effects, reducing time spent calculating these elements during play.
Health and Injuries:

Clarification:
Weapon Mechanics and Environment Interactions: If these mechanics are present (but not yet shown in the excerpt), they could be clarified with examples to reinforce the narrative-driven combat system.
Optional Rules: Clarify how these are intended to be integrated into the core system. Are they recommendations for GMs or advanced mechanics for experienced players?
