In this chapter, we invite you to explore the very essence of conflict resolution, guiding you through the intricate dance of engagements, the strategic crossroads, and the unfolding narratives that arise from your choices. Introduction to Conflict Before the first clash of weapons and the casting of spells, let us set the stage. Imagine a world brimming with anticipation, where the air crackles with tension, and the paths of adversaries converge. An introduction to conflict offers a glimpse into the impending struggle, framing the stakes, motives, and emotions that fuel the impending battle. With each player and foe poised on the precipice, the narrative emerges, waiting for you to seize its threads. Igniting Tension - With an introduction in place, the atmosphere thickens as tension takes root. Feel the electricity in the air as combatants sense the imminent clash. Each decision, each skill chosen, becomes a brushstroke on the canvas of narrative possibilities. Like a composer orchestrating a symphony, you and your opponents add notes of anticipation, uncertainty, and strategy to the unfolding tale. Commencing the Engagement - As the narrative crescendos, the combatants step onto the stage. Your character, armed with chosen skills, faces adversaries whose intents and actions are equally bound by fate and choice. Here, the flow of conflict hinges on the interplay of the dice\u2014a roll of two six-sided dice (2d6) that will determine the outcome of your endeavors. Each move, a dance between your chosen skill and the roll of dice, shapes the progression of the battle. Unfolding the Duel - With the dice cast and skills employed, the narrative springs to life. Attack and defense, choice and consequence\u2014all are woven into the ebb and flow of the duel. The outcome of each interaction hinges on the harmony between skill rolls and dice results. The combatants, locked in a dance of fate and strategy, push the narrative forward with every exchange, every calculated move. Pivotal Decisions - Amidst the exchanges of blows and parries, moments of significance emerge like beacons in the night. Critical hits and fumbles introduce unexpected turns, shifting the tide of battle with unforeseen outcomes. A choice to counterattack, a masterful spellcast, or even a momentary vulnerability\u2014the narrative twists and turns with the dice, leaving you on the edge of your seat as the story unfolds. Culmination and Aftermath - As the rhythm of combat reaches its crescendo, the climax draws near. The culmination of decisions and dice rolls casts the die for victory or retreat, triumph or setback. Wounds and triumphs, etched in the fabric of the narrative, linger as tokens of the struggle. Whether emerging victorious or stepping back to reassess, the aftermath of combat is marked by scars, lessons, and the ever-present narrative web. Continuing the Journey - The tale never truly ends, even as the combat concludes. Decisions ripple outward, intertwining with character growth, relationships, and the overarching narrative. Each engagement becomes a brushstroke in the canvas of your character's journey, a testament to the choices you make and the dice you roll. So, let us journey deeper into the mechanisms that shape Eidos' combat, exploring skills, strategy, and the fluid interplay of dice and destiny. In the pages that follow, we unravel the intricacies of Eidos' combat mechanics, guiding you through the art of engaging foes, mastering skills, and embracing the stories that emerge from the crucible of conflict. Narrative-Based Combat In the realm of Eidos, combat takes on a narrative hue, weaving together the art of storytelling and the thrill of dice mechanics. This innovative combat system revolves around the choices you make and the roll of dice, aligning the stars of fate with the threads of your character's journey. Each turn unveils a canvas of possibilities as you select a skill that mirrors your intended action, connecting each move with a distinctive skill. Whether you're grasping the hilt of a blade, conjuring arcane spells, or channeling unique abilities, the skill you choose shapes the unfolding tale of the battle. Engaging Multiple Enemies The battlefield is not always a solo stage; often, it hosts a symphony of adversaries. When you find yourself ensnared by the presence of multiple foes, the tempo of your strategy changes. Confronting two enemies necessitates an adaptive approach. Your conflict resolution becomes a dance of dice, as you roll two six-sided dice (2d6) for your adversaries and compare their combined roll against your own. The rhythm of battle is further seasoned by the capabilities of diverse non-human adversaries, some bearing more than a single six-sided die, reflecting their potency. Chained Events Within the fluid tapestry of combat, each engagement initiates a cascade of actions that ripple through the battlefield. This entwined progression persists until one side emerges victorious or the combatants disengage, leaving behind the echoes of their decisions and rolls. Let's dive deeper into the rich dynamics of Eidos' combat by unraveling the chain of events in greater detail: Initiative Determination: As the curtain rises on combat's stage, the question of initiative takes center stage. The dice of destiny roll, casting their vote on which side seizes the advantage first. Whether the combatants share an awareness of each other's intent or the shadows of uncertainty loom, the dice arbitrate this pivotal choice. Should both you and your opponent intend to attack, an additional roll of the dice commences, illuminating the starting player. Defensive Stance: Amidst the whirlwind of conflict, you may opt to embrace a defensive stance, prioritizing prudence over aggression. This calculated path bestows upon you a defensive bonus of +2 to your roll, at the expense of forgoing an immediate attack. Your readiness to repel your adversary's advances transforms into a stalwart shield, lending you an edge as you confront incoming assaults. Initial Attack: With initiative established and defensive strategies weighed, the stage is set for the opening gambit. This attack, a manifestation of your chosen skill bolstered by the roll of a six-sided die (1d6), heralds the prologue of the combat's intricate dance. The dice unfurl their secrets, deciding the fate of your strike\u2014whether it pierces true or meets the staunch resistance of your adversary's defenses. Defensive Maneuvers: The recipient of the initial attack, be it a successful hit that lands or a deft defense that parries, steps into the role of the defender. A repertoire of defensive maneuvers\u2014parrying, dodging, strategic bracing\u2014unfurls as tools in their arsenal. The dice once again ascend the stage, adjudicating the efficacy of these agile evasions. Counterattack and Retaliation: A successful defense may breathe life into the flames of counterattack. The balance of battle shifts as the defender capitalizes on an opening, seeking to turn the tide with a retaliatory strike. The dice, bearing witness to the ever-shifting tides of fortune, unfurl the outcome\u2014whether this counterattack lands with impactful force or merely grazes its intended mark. Unforeseen Interruptions: Amidst the intricate choreography of blows and strategic defensive maneuvers, the stage permits for unexpected disruptions. Special abilities, moments of tactical insight, or the intervention of serendipitous fortune grant you the opportunity to break the rhythm of your opponent's actions. When you opt to interrupt, the impartial dice step forward to declare the verdict on the success of your strategic interference. Continued Sequences: Within the ebb and flow of combat, a sequence of cascading actions unfolds. Each successful attack and resilient defense becomes a thread woven into the ongoing tapestry of battle. The dice roll, your chosen skill guides the path, and the rhythm of engagement persists\u2014a true reflection of the fluid, dynamic nature of combat. Reckoning and Culmination: With the interplay of attack, defense, and counterattack progressing, the narrative inches ever closer to its zenith. Wounds accumulate, strategies unfurl, and choices accrue momentum. Dice and destiny unite in a crescendo, marking a reckoning where the culmination of actions echoes through the clash, shaping the climax of battle. Post-Combat Reflection: As the final dice tumble and the echoes of combat fade, the aftermath of battle assumes the spotlight. Wounds endured, tactics employed, choices etched\u2014the ripples of combat extend beyond its cessation. Characters emerge from the fray transformed, their narratives further woven into the expansive fabric of the overarching story. In Eidos, combat unfurls as a symphony of choices and dice, a dynamic ballet of strategy and fate. These chained events mirror the ebb and flow of battle, where every decision, every dice roll, and every interaction layers depth into your character's journey and the grand tapestry of the overarching narrative. Now, let us step onto the battlefield, where every footfall, every choice, reverberates through the continuum of conflict. Injury and Consequences Eidos introduces a realistic and detailed approach to injury, ensuring that every hit carries weight. When an attack lands, it's not merely a matter of dealing damage\u2014it's about determining the specific injury inflicted. Injury Tables Each attack's success prompts a roll on a corresponding injury table. For example, an attacker aims for a specific body part like the neck and successfully hits, the player rolls the \"Cutting in Neck Damage Table\" to determine the outcome. These tables define the consequences, ranging from minor wounds to severe trauma. Type of Damage Description Cutting Damage caused by sharp-edged weapons Stabbing Damage caused by piercing weapons Impact Damage from blunt force or crushing attacks Fire Damage from burns or heat sources Acid Damage from corrosive acids or chemicals Body Part Description Head The uppermost part of the body Torso The main part of the body, including chest Left Arm The left arm and hand Right

The aftermath of combat may leave scars or lingering effects, adding depth to your character's journey. Recovery and Lasting Impact The aftermath of combat extends beyond the battlefield. Players who survive are left to recover from their wounds, with lasting scars as tokens of their trials.

As you continue your exploration of this system, embrace the intricate interplay of choice, strategy, and chance that defines Eidos' unique combat and conflict resolution mechanics. Sample Combat Scenario Let's step into the world of Eidos with a sample combat scenario: Alice, a seasoned warrior, faces two foes: a cunning rogue and a fearsome orc. Both enemies possess their unique skills and dice. Alice opts to attack the rogue with her sword. She rolls her skill and 2d6, achieving a total of 9. The rogue's defense is surpassed, and Alice's attack hits. She consults the \"Cutting in Torso Damage Table,\" rolling a 5. The table reveals a deep cut that leaves the rogue bleeding. The rogue, in turn, counters with a swift strike, launching a counterattack chain. The combat sequence unfolds, each action determining the subsequent move. Alice's choices and dice rolls shape the narrative, leading to either triumph or a strategic retreat. Eidos embraces the complex web of combat narratives, dice rolls, and consequences.

When you find yourself ensnared by the presence of multiple foes, the tempo of your strategy changes. Confronting two enemies necessitates an adaptive approach. Your conflict resolution becomes a dance of dice, as you roll two six-sided dice (2d6) for your adversaries and compare their combined roll against your own. The rhythm of battle is further seasoned by the capabilities of diverse non-human adversaries, some bearing more than a single six-sided die, reflecting their potency.","title":"Engaging Multiple Enemies"},{"location":"combat/#chained-events","text":"Within the fluid tapestry of combat, each engagement initiates a cascade of actions that ripple through the battlefield. This entwined progression persists until one side emerges victorious or the combatants disengage, leaving behind the echoes of their decisions and rolls. Let's dive deeper into the rich dynamics of Eidos' combat by unraveling the chain of events in greater detail: Initiative Determination: As the curtain rises on combat's stage, the question of initiative takes center stage. The dice of destiny roll, casting their vote on which side seizes the advantage first. Whether the combatants share an awareness of each other's intent or the shadows of uncertainty loom, the dice arbitrate this pivotal choice. Should both you and your opponent intend to attack, an additional roll of the dice commences, illuminating the starting player. Defensive Stance: Amidst the whirlwind of conflict, you may opt to embrace a defensive stance, prioritizing prudence over aggression. This calculated path bestows upon you a defensive bonus of +2 to your roll, at the expense of forgoing an immediate attack. Your readiness to repel your adversary's advances transforms into a stalwart shield, lending you an edge as you confront incoming assaults. Initial Attack: With initiative established and defensive strategies weighed, the stage is set for the opening gambit. This attack, a manifestation of your chosen skill bolstered by the roll of a six-sided die (1d6), heralds the prologue of the combat's intricate dance. The dice unfurl their secrets, deciding the fate of your strike\u2014whether it pierces true or meets the staunch resistance of your adversary's defenses. Defensive Maneuvers: The recipient of the initial attack, be it a successful hit that lands or a deft defense that parries, steps into the role of the defender. A repertoire of defensive maneuvers\u2014parrying, dodging, strategic bracing\u2014unfurls as tools in their arsenal. The dice once again ascend the stage, adjudicating the efficacy of these agile evasions. Counterattack and Retaliation: A successful defense may breathe life into the flames of counterattack. The balance of battle shifts as the defender capitalizes on an opening, seeking to turn the tide with a retaliatory strike. The dice, bearing witness to the ever-shifting tides of fortune, unfurl the outcome\u2014whether this counterattack lands with impactful force or merely grazes its intended mark. Unforeseen Interruptions: Amidst the intricate choreography of blows and strategic defensive maneuvers, the stage permits for unexpected disruptions. Special abilities, moments of tactical insight, or the intervention of serendipitous fortune grant you the opportunity to break the rhythm of your opponent's actions. When you opt to interrupt, the impartial dice step forward to declare the verdict on the success of your strategic interference. Continued Sequences: Within the ebb and flow of combat, a sequence of cascading actions unfolds. Each successful attack and resilient defense becomes a thread woven into the ongoing tapestry of battle. The dice roll, your chosen skill guides the path, and the rhythm of engagement persists\u2014a true reflection of the fluid, dynamic nature of combat.

Wounds accumulate, strategies unfurl, and choices accrue momentum. Dice and destiny unite in a crescendo, marking a reckoning where the culmination of actions echoes through the clash, shaping the climax of battle.

Of course it its not a carbon copie, some modifications will be needed to fit his tables in the system. Anyway, credits must be given and you should check out his guide. Primary Motivators The first step in crafting a character's personality is selecting their primary and secondary motivators. These motivations serve as the driving force behind a character's actions and decisions, shaping the narrative of their journey. The primary motivator is particularly important, as it acts as the primary catalyst for a character's backstory and personality. It is the underlying theme of a character's motivations, guiding their behavior and propelling them forward. When choosing these motivations, it's important to consider what your character wants most in the world. Is it wealth, power, love, revenge, or something else? By focusing on these motivations, players can ensure that their character's actions feel authentic and grounded in their personal desires.

It allows you to understand how your character is likely to react emotionally to different situations, as well as how they appear to others. This trait helps you create a believable and relatable character, giving them an emotional landscape that makes sense within the context of the story. When determining your character's emotional disposition, it is important to keep in mind that it is not necessarily limiting. It simply provides a baseline for how your character is likely to feel at any given moment. A character with a predominantly cheerful disposition may still experience moments of sadness, anger, or anxiety, but they will be more likely to return to their cheerful state after those moments have passed. It is also important to note that emotional disposition should not be equated with alignment. A character's disposition can exist independently of their moral or ethical alignment, and it is possible for a character to be joyfully evil or angrily good. Understanding your character's disposition will help you make decisions about their emotional reactions, but it is just one aspect of the complex and multifaceted personality that you are creating. Joyful Anxious Melancholy Curious Calm Angry Contemptuous Excited Apathetic Ashamed Moodiness Moodiness is an important aspect of a character's personality and can greatly impact their behavior in different situations. A character who is labile, or quick to experience intense emotions, is likely to react strongly to the events happening around them. This can make them appear impulsive and prone to outbursts, but it can also add a level of excitement and unpredictability to their actions. On the other hand, a phlegmatic character, who is psychologically consistent and moderate, is likely to maintain their composure in even the most trying of situations. This calm demeanor can give them a sense of stability and reliability, but it can also make them appear uninterested or indifferent to the world around them. It is important to note that both moodiness traits have their own strengths and weaknesses, and they can greatly impact a character's relationships with other characters. For example, a labile character may be prone to jealousy or resentment, while a phlegmatic character may struggle with expressing their emotions effectively. Choosing the right moodiness trait for your character can help you build a more complete and well-rounded personality. Ultimately, the key to making a character's moodiness work for them is understanding the underlying motivations and dispositions that drive their behavior. Whether your character is quick to experience intense emotions or stays calm and collected in the face of adversity, the key is to make sure that their moodiness feels true to who they are as a character. By incorporating moodiness into your character's personality, you can add depth and richness to your role-playing experience and help bring your character to life on the tabletop. Labile Even-tempered Phlegmatic Outlook The concept of outlook is an important aspect of character creation as it defines the basic worldview of a character and helps determine their overall view of the world around them. This trait can greatly influence the choices that a character makes and the way they interact with others. A character with a positive outlook is likely to see the good in people and situations, while a character with a negative outlook is likely to be more skeptical and pessimistic. Understanding a character's outlook is key to understanding their motivations and how they may react in different situations. It is important to note that a character's outlook does not dictate their alignment, as a character can have a positive outlook but still make morally questionable decisions. This trait helps to add depth and complexity to a character, making them feel more real and unique. Outlook Description Optimistic Idealistic, confident, trusting, hopeful, upbeat Pessimistic Cynical, bleak, distrustful, foreboding, resigned Integrity Integrity refers to the values that guide a character's behavior in work and social interactions. When creating a character, players can choose between two options that embody different qualities and tendencies. The first option is \"Conscientious\", which represents being industrious, honest, responsible, meticulous, and pragmatic. On the other hand, the second option is \"Unscrupulous\", which embodies being lazy, deceitful, unreliable, manipulative, slipshod, and impractical. These two options serve as a starting point for players to develop their character's personality and decision-making. The choice of integrity will play a crucial role in determining a character's motivations and actions, influencing the character's interactions with others and the events of the story. Integrity Description Conscientious Industrious, honest, responsible, meticulous, pragmatic Unscrupulous Lazy, deceitful, unreliable, manipulative, slipshod, impractical Impulsiveness The next aspect of character creation to consider is impulsiveness. This trait refers to a character's ability to regulate their thoughts and actions. Players must choose between two options: controlled or spontaneous. A controlled character is deliberate, focused, steady, and thoughtful. They carefully consider their decisions and think before they act. On the other hand, a spontaneous character is capricious, flighty, hyperactive, and rash. They are quick to act without thinking through the consequences of their actions. It's important to consider impulsiveness as it can greatly impact the way a character approaches situations and reacts to stimuli. A controlled character may be more reliable and level-headed, while a spontaneous character may be more unpredictable and exciting. Ultimately, the choice of impulsiveness helps to round out a character's personality and inform their behavior. Impulsiveness Description Controlled Deliberate, focused, steady, thoughtful Spontaneous Capricious, flighty, hyperactive, rash Boldness When it comes to creating a character's personality, it is important to consider their boldness, or willingness to face danger and enter into battle. This trait can greatly impact how a character approaches conflict and adversity, and can inform their actions and decisions in high-pressure situations. There are two main options for this characteristic: intrepid and cautious. Intrepid characters are daring, reckless, and valorous. They have a confident demeanor and are not easily intimidated by danger. They are known for their bravery and audacity in the face of adversity, and are often seen as leaders in combat situations. On the other hand, cautious characters are timid, paranoid, and vigilant. They are nervous and tentative in the face of danger, preferring to assess the situation before making a move. They are not as quick to jump into action, but their carefulness can often lead to a more strategic approach to conflict. Boldness Description Intrepid Daring, reckless, valorous, dauntless, audacious, confident Cautious Timid, paranoid, vigilant, nervous, tentative Agreeableness The sub-topic of \"Agreeableness\" deals with a character's overall attitude towards others and their ability to handle interpersonal conflicts and new situations. This trait is particularly important in shaping a character's behavior in social interactions and their ability to navigate challenging circumstances. A character who is described as \"Agreeable\" is warm, empathetic, and open-minded, possessing qualities such as tolerance, forgiveness, and adaptability. On the other hand, a character who is described as \"Disagreeable\" is cold and rigid, possessing traits such as tension, intractability, and narrow-mindedness. Understanding a character's level of agreeableness can give insight into how they are likely to respond in social and interpersonal situations. Agreeableness Description Agreeable Warm, empathic, tolerant, forgiving, open-minded, adaptable, altruistic Disagreeable Cold, rigid, tense, intractable, narrow-minded, cantankerous, stingy Interactivity The next sub-topic in character creation is Interactivity, which deals with the way your character interacts with others. This aspect of personality is crucial in shaping the character's social relationships and determining how they engage with the world around them. The table of choices in Interactivity includes two options: Engaging and Reserved. An Engaging character is often talkative, candid, and touchy, while a Reserved character is usually shy, preferring to keep to themselves and be more reserved in their interactions. Understanding this aspect of your character will greatly enhance the depth of your role-playing experience and allow you to build compelling, engaging stories. Interactivity Description Engaging Talkative, candid, entertaining, touchy Reserved Shy, loner, taciturn, evasive, cryptic Conformity Conformity is an important aspect of a character's personality, determining their relationship with cultural norms and societal expectations. A character who is conventional is likely to follow orthodox beliefs and practices, be formal in their demeanor, and adhere to mainstream customs. On the other hand, a character who is heterodox may be rebellious in nature, have a creative and artistic streak, and may be known for their freethinking and exotic choices. Understanding a character's conformity can give insight into how they view and interact with the world around them. Conformity Description Conventional Orthodox, formal, down-to-earth, mainstream, traditional Heterodox Rebellious, arty, shocking, freethinking, exotic Quirks, Habits, and Oddities To help bring your character to life and add depth to gameplay, consider incorporating small quirks, habits, and oddities into their personality. These unique behavioral characteristics can range from relatively harmless habits, such as humming or lip biting, to more engaging and potentially entertaining quirks such as exhibitionism or sleepwalking. By adding these small but meaningful details to your character, you can bring them to life in a way that sets them apart from the rest of the party. These quirks, habits, and oddities can offer a multitude of role-playing opportunities. They can help flesh out a character's backstory, provide unique challenges or benefits during gameplay, and even influence the way they interact with other characters. For example, a character who is a compulsive liar may struggle with building trust with others, while a character who is an animal hater may have trouble working with characters who have animal companions. Whether you choose to focus on the more harmless or more engaging quirks, incorporating these small behaviors into your character can greatly enhance your role-playing experience. 1. Humming 31.

Sense of Humor Sense of Humor is an important aspect of a character's personality and can be used to show their humor preferences and how they might react in different situations. It ranges from crude humor to dry wit and includes various styles such as slapstick, jokey, cynical, prankster, mean-spirited, gleeful, and surreal. By selecting one of these options, you can help to define your character's sense of humor and how they might react in different situations. Having a strong sense of humor can also be a way for your character to diffuse tense situations, and can be used to show their lighter side. Ultimately, your character's sense of humor is a tool that you can use to further develop their personality and bring them to life in your storytelling. Crude Dry Slapstick Jokey Cynical Prankster Mean-spirited Gleeful Surreal Mental Disorders In this RPG system, we aim to provide an accurate representation of human mental and emotional disorders.

Topics of Conversation One helpful way to bring depth to your character is to determine what they like to talk about in casual social situations. People are naturally inclined to talk about things they are skilled in or have a personal interest in, and this is an easy way to help flesh out your character. By examining your character's skills, hobbies, training, and background, you can start to determine what topics they might be passionate about. This information can be used to create a more complete picture of who your character is and how they interact with others in social situations. By giving your character a few key topics they like to discuss, you can help bring them to life and make them more memorable to other players.

It is the underlying theme of a character's motivations, guiding their behavior and propelling them forward. When choosing these motivations, it's important to consider what your character wants most in the world. Is it wealth, power, love, revenge, or something else?

This chapter will detail the mechanics behind the Spirituality Sheet, including the options available for defining the strength of a character's belief or association with a religious system, as well as any relevant traits and skills that may impact the character's spirituality and religious beliefs. Whether playing as a devout follower of a particular faith or a non-believer, the Spirituality Sheet will help players bring their character to life and create a more immersive role-playing experience. Adherence The \"Adherence\" field on the character sheet represents the strength of the character's belief or association with a particular religious or spiritual system. The options for this field range from non-believer to orthodox adherent, providing a spectrum of beliefs that a character can possess. The non-believer is someone who does not hold any belief in a higher power, whereas an agnostic is someone who is uncertain about the existence of a higher power. On the other hand, a casual adherent is someone who holds a loose connection to their religious or spiritual beliefs, and an orthodox adherent is someone who strictly follows the teachings and practices of their chosen system. This mechanic helps to further flesh out the character and their motivations, and provides a lens through which the character may view the world around them.

In determining the level of tolerance, there are three options available for the player to choose from: Inclusive, Tolerant, or Intolerant. The level of tolerance selected will affect how the character interacts with people of different beliefs and religions in the game world.

To reflect this, the player will be presented with three different fields to fill out.
