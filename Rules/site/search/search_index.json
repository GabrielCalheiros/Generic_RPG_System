Of course it its not a carbon copie, some modifications will be needed to fit his tables in the system. Anyway, credits must be given and you should check out his guide. Primary Motivators The first step in crafting a character's personality is selecting their primary and secondary motivators. These motivations serve as the driving force behind a character's actions and decisions, shaping the narrative of their journey. The primary motivator is particularly important, as it acts as the primary catalyst for a character's backstory and personality. It is the underlying theme of a character's motivations, guiding their behavior and propelling them forward. When choosing these motivations, it's important to consider what your character wants most in the world. Is it wealth, power, love, revenge, or something else? By focusing on these motivations, players can ensure that their character's actions feel authentic and grounded in their personal desires. Whether facing challenges in combat or navigating complex social situations, characters driven by strong motivators will always have a clear direction and purpose. No. Theme Description 1 Achievement To overcome obstacles and succeed; to become the best 2 Acquisition To obtain possessions/wealth 3 Adoration To be cherished, admired, and wanted by others 4 Balance/Peace To bring all things into harmony and equilibrium 5 Beneficence To protect the helpless, heal the sick, feed the hungry, etc. 6 Chaos To disrupt, to cause confusion and discord 7 Competition To seek out or create rule-based win/lose scenarios; to defeat others in contests 8 Conflict To seek out or create rivalry, fighting, or animosity 9 Conquest To conquer other peoples, to bring them into one\u2019s own culture/rule 10 Corruption To despoil, ruin, humiliate, or make depraved 11 Creation To build or make new, such as art, culture, invention, design, etc. 12 Destruction To annihilate, exterminate, and unmake 13 Discovery/Adventure To explore, uncover mysteries, and pioneer 14 Domesticity To get married, have children, and live a family life 15 Education To provide information, teach, enlighten, or train 16 Entertainment To entertain, amuse, and delight others 17 Enslavement To force others into servitude 18 Hedonism To enjoy all things sensuous 19 Heroism To find valor and honor through battle or self-sacrifice 20 Liberation To free the self and/or others from perceived captivity or enslavement 21 Love To experience/share affection and emotional commitment, romantic or platonic 22 Nobility/Honor To exalt ideals such as generosity, honesty, bravery, and courtliness 23 Order To arrange, organize, and reduce chaos 24 Play To have fun, to enjoy life 25 Power To control and lead others 26 Proselytization To spread a belief system; indoctrinate others 27 Purity To achieve a state of moral or spiritual perfection, of self and/or others 28 Rebellion To fight against power structures; to undermine authority 29 Recognition To gain approval, social status, or fame 30 Service To follow a person, government, order, religion, etc. 31 Torment To inflict pain and suffering, on others and/or the self 32 Understanding To seek knowledge or wisdom (spiritual, scientific, magical, etc) 33 Vice To enable or engage in self-destructive behavior Dispositions Disposition is an important aspect of character creation that provides depth and dimension to your character's personality. It allows you to understand how your character is likely to react emotionally to different situations, as well as how they appear to others. This trait helps you create a believable and relatable character, giving them an emotional landscape that makes sense within the context of the story. When determining your character's emotional disposition, it is important to keep in mind that it is not necessarily limiting. It simply provides a baseline for how your character is likely to feel at any given moment. A character with a predominantly cheerful disposition may still experience moments of sadness, anger, or anxiety, but they will be more likely to return to their cheerful state after those moments have passed. It is also important to note that emotional disposition should not be equated with alignment. A character's disposition can exist independently of their moral or ethical alignment, and it is possible for a character to be joyfully evil or angrily good. Understanding your character's disposition will help you make decisions about their emotional reactions, but it is just one aspect of the complex and multifaceted personality that you are creating. Joyful Anxious Melancholy Curious Calm Angry Contemptuous Excited Apathetic Ashamed Moodiness Moodiness is an important aspect of a character's personality and can greatly impact their behavior in different situations. A character who is labile, or quick to experience intense emotions, is likely to react strongly to the events happening around them. This can make them appear impulsive and prone to outbursts, but it can also add a level of excitement and unpredictability to their actions. On the other hand, a phlegmatic character, who is psychologically consistent and moderate, is likely to maintain their composure in even the most trying of situations. This calm demeanor can give them a sense of stability and reliability, but it can also make them appear uninterested or indifferent to the world around them. It is important to note that both moodiness traits have their own strengths and weaknesses, and they can greatly impact a character's relationships with other characters. For example, a labile character may be prone to jealousy or resentment, while a phlegmatic character may struggle with expressing their emotions effectively. Choosing the right moodiness trait for your character can help you build a more complete and well-rounded personality. Ultimately, the key to making a character's moodiness work for them is understanding the underlying motivations and dispositions that drive their behavior. Whether your character is quick to experience intense emotions or stays calm and collected in the face of adversity, the key is to make sure that their moodiness feels true to who they are as a character. By incorporating moodiness into your character's personality, you can add depth and richness to your role-playing experience and help bring your character to life on the tabletop. Labile Even-tempered Phlegmatic Outlook The concept of outlook is an important aspect of character creation as it defines the basic worldview of a character and helps determine their overall view of the world around them. This trait can greatly influence the choices that a character makes and the way they interact with others. A character with a positive outlook is likely to see the good in people and situations, while a character with a negative outlook is likely to be more skeptical and pessimistic. Understanding a character's outlook is key to understanding their motivations and how they may react in different situations. It is important to note that a character's outlook does not dictate their alignment, as a character can have a positive outlook but still make morally questionable decisions. This trait helps to add depth and complexity to a character, making them feel more real and unique. Outlook Description Optimistic Idealistic, confident, trusting, hopeful, upbeat Pessimistic Cynical, bleak, distrustful, foreboding, resigned Integrity Integrity refers to the values that guide a character's behavior in work and social interactions. When creating a character, players can choose between two options that embody different qualities and tendencies. The first option is \"Conscientious\", which represents being industrious, honest, responsible, meticulous, and pragmatic. On the other hand, the second option is \"Unscrupulous\", which embodies being lazy, deceitful, unreliable, manipulative, slipshod, and impractical. These two options serve as a starting point for players to develop their character's personality and decision-making. The choice of integrity will play a crucial role in determining a character's motivations and actions, influencing the character's interactions with others and the events of the story. Integrity Description Conscientious Industrious, honest, responsible, meticulous, pragmatic Unscrupulous Lazy, deceitful, unreliable, manipulative, slipshod, impractical Impulsiveness The next aspect of character creation to consider is impulsiveness. This trait refers to a character's ability to regulate their thoughts and actions. Players must choose between two options: controlled or spontaneous. A controlled character is deliberate, focused, steady, and thoughtful. They carefully consider their decisions and think before they act. On the other hand, a spontaneous character is capricious, flighty, hyperactive, and rash. They are quick to act without thinking through the consequences of their actions. It's important to consider impulsiveness as it can greatly impact the way a character approaches situations and reacts to stimuli. A controlled character may be more reliable and level-headed, while a spontaneous character may be more unpredictable and exciting. Ultimately, the choice of impulsiveness helps to round out a character's personality and inform their behavior. Impulsiveness Description Controlled Deliberate, focused, steady, thoughtful Spontaneous Capricious, flighty, hyperactive, rash Boldness When it comes to creating a character's personality, it is important to consider their boldness, or willingness to face danger and enter into battle. This trait can greatly impact how a character approaches conflict and adversity, and can inform their actions and decisions in high-pressure situations. There are two main options for this characteristic: intrepid and cautious. Intrepid characters are daring, reckless, and valorous. They have a confident demeanor and are not easily intimidated by danger. They are known for their bravery and audacity in the face of adversity, and are often seen as leaders in combat situations. On the other hand, cautious characters are timid, paranoid, and vigilant. They are nervous and tentative in the face of danger, preferring to assess the situation before making a move. They are not as quick to jump into action, but their carefulness can often lead to a more strategic approach to conflict. Boldness Description Intrepid Daring, reckless, valorous, dauntless, audacious, confident Cautious Timid, paranoid, vigilant, nervous, tentative Agreeableness The sub-topic of \"Agreeableness\" deals with a character's overall attitude towards others and their ability to handle interpersonal conflicts and new situations. This trait is particularly important in shaping a character's behavior in social interactions and their ability to navigate challenging circumstances. A character who is described as \"Agreeable\" is warm, empathetic, and open-minded, possessing qualities such as tolerance, forgiveness, and adaptability. On the other hand, a character who is described as \"Disagreeable\" is cold and rigid, possessing traits such as tension, intractability, and narrow-mindedness. Understanding a character's level of agreeableness can give insight into how they are likely to respond in social and interpersonal situations. Agreeableness Description Agreeable Warm, empathic, tolerant, forgiving, open-minded, adaptable, altruistic Disagreeable Cold, rigid, tense, intractable, narrow-minded, cantankerous, stingy Interactivity The next sub-topic in character creation is Interactivity, which deals with the way your character interacts with others. This aspect of personality is crucial in shaping the character's social relationships and determining how they engage with the world around them. The table of choices in Interactivity includes two options: Engaging and Reserved. An Engaging character is often talkative, candid, and touchy, while a Reserved character is usually shy, preferring to keep to themselves and be more reserved in their interactions. Understanding this aspect of your character will greatly enhance the depth of your role-playing experience and allow you to build compelling, engaging stories. Interactivity Description Engaging Talkative, candid, entertaining, touchy Reserved Shy, loner, taciturn, evasive, cryptic Conformity Conformity is an important aspect of a character's personality, determining their relationship with cultural norms and societal expectations. A character who is conventional is likely to follow orthodox beliefs and practices, be formal in their demeanor, and adhere to mainstream customs. On the other hand, a character who is heterodox may be rebellious in nature, have a creative and artistic streak, and may be known for their freethinking and exotic choices. Understanding a character's conformity can give insight into how they view and interact with the world around them. Conformity Description Conventional Orthodox, formal, down-to-earth, mainstream, traditional Heterodox Rebellious, arty, shocking, freethinking, exotic Quirks, Habits, and Oddities To help bring your character to life and add depth to gameplay, consider incorporating small quirks, habits, and oddities into their personality. These unique behavioral characteristics can range from relatively harmless habits, such as humming or lip biting, to more engaging and potentially entertaining quirks such as exhibitionism or sleepwalking. By adding these small but meaningful details to your character, you can bring them to life in a way that sets them apart from the rest of the party. These quirks, habits, and oddities can offer a multitude of role-playing opportunities. They can help flesh out a character's backstory, provide unique challenges or benefits during gameplay, and even influence the way they interact with other characters. For example, a character who is a compulsive liar may struggle with building trust with others, while a character who is an animal hater may have trouble working with characters who have animal companions. Whether you choose to focus on the more harmless or more engaging quirks, incorporating these small behaviors into your character can greatly enhance your role-playing experience. 1. Humming 31.

Sense of Humor Sense of Humor is an important aspect of a character's personality and can be used to show their humor preferences and how they might react in different situations. It ranges from crude humor to dry wit and includes various styles such as slapstick, jokey, cynical, prankster, mean-spirited, gleeful, and surreal. By selecting one of these options, you can help to define your character's sense of humor and how they might react in different situations. Having a strong sense of humor can also be a way for your character to diffuse tense situations, and can be used to show their lighter side. Ultimately, your character's sense of humor is a tool that you can use to further develop their personality and bring them to life in your storytelling. Crude Dry Slapstick Jokey Cynical Prankster Mean-spirited Gleeful Surreal Mental Disorders In this RPG system, we aim to provide an accurate representation of human mental and emotional disorders. While we understand that not all players may want their character to struggle with such issues, it does present an opportunity for unique and interesting role-play. For this reason, we suggest that players consider assigning these disorders to non-player characters, adding depth and complexity to the game world. It's important to note that the list provided is not exhaustive and only offers brief descriptions.

Topics of Conversation One helpful way to bring depth to your character is to determine what they like to talk about in casual social situations. People are naturally inclined to talk about things they are skilled in or have a personal interest in, and this is an easy way to help flesh out your character. By examining your character's skills, hobbies, training, and background, you can start to determine what topics they might be passionate about. This information can be used to create a more complete picture of who your character is and how they interact with others in social situations. By giving your character a few key topics they like to discuss, you can help bring them to life and make them more memorable to other players. Conclusion In conclusion, the character's personality is a crucial aspect in role-playing games and helps to bring the character to life. This chapter has covered a range of fields that allow players to flesh out their characters, including alignment, morality, values, beliefs, religion and spirituality, and quirks.

When determining your character's emotional disposition, it is important to keep in mind that it is not necessarily limiting. It simply provides a baseline for how your character is likely to feel at any given moment. A character with a predominantly cheerful disposition may still experience moments of sadness, anger, or anxiety, but they will be more likely to return to their cheerful state after those moments have passed. It is also important to note that emotional disposition should not be equated with alignment. A character's disposition can exist independently of their moral or ethical alignment, and it is possible for a character to be joyfully evil or angrily good. Understanding your character's disposition will help you make decisions about their emotional reactions, but it is just one aspect of the complex and multifaceted personality that you are creating.

A character who is labile, or quick to experience intense emotions, is likely to react strongly to the events happening around them. This can make them appear impulsive and prone to outbursts, but it can also add a level of excitement and unpredictability to their actions. On the other hand, a phlegmatic character, who is psychologically consistent and moderate, is likely to maintain their composure in even the most trying of situations. This calm demeanor can give them a sense of stability and reliability, but it can also make them appear uninterested or indifferent to the world around them. It is important to note that both moodiness traits have their own strengths and weaknesses, and they can greatly impact a character's relationships with other characters. For example, a labile character may be prone to jealousy or resentment, while a phlegmatic character may struggle with expressing their emotions effectively. Choosing the right moodiness trait for your character can help you build a more complete and well-rounded personality. Ultimately, the key to making a character's moodiness work for them is understanding the underlying motivations and dispositions that drive their behavior. Whether your character is quick to experience intense emotions or stays calm and collected in the face of adversity, the key is to make sure that their moodiness feels true to who they are as a character. By incorporating moodiness into your character's personality, you can add depth and richness to your role-playing experience and help bring your character to life on the tabletop.

Understanding a character's outlook is key to understanding their motivations and how they may react in different situations.

The Spirituality Sheet is an integral part of character creation and is designed to help players define their character's connection to the spiritual and religious aspects of the game world. This chapter will detail the mechanics behind the Spirituality Sheet, including the options available for defining the strength of a character's belief or association with a religious system, as well as any relevant traits and skills that may impact the character's spirituality and religious beliefs. Whether playing as a devout follower of a particular faith or a non-believer, the Spirituality Sheet will help players bring their character to life and create a more immersive role-playing experience. Adherence The \"Adherence\" field on the character sheet represents the strength of the character's belief or association with a particular religious or spiritual system. The options for this field range from non-believer to orthodox adherent, providing a spectrum of beliefs that a character can possess. The non-believer is someone who does not hold any belief in a higher power, whereas an agnostic is someone who is uncertain about the existence of a higher power. On the other hand, a casual adherent is someone who holds a loose connection to their religious or spiritual beliefs, and an orthodox adherent is someone who strictly follows the teachings and practices of their chosen system. This mechanic helps to further flesh out the character and their motivations, and provides a lens through which the character may view the world around them. Non-believer Agnostic Casual adherent Orthodox adherent Tolerance This field reflects the character's willingness to accept differences of belief in others. In determining the level of tolerance, there are three options available for the player to choose from: Inclusive, Tolerant, or Intolerant. The level of tolerance selected will affect how the character interacts with people of different beliefs and religions in the game world. Inclusive Tolerant Intolerant Religious Demeanor The field \"RELIGIOUS DEMEANOR\" on the character sheet aims to capture how your character tends to act in regards to religious beliefs. To reflect this, the player will be presented with three different fields to fill out. The first field is \"Expression of beliefs\" and asks the player to decide on the frequency at which their character expresses their beliefs. The options range from \"None\", \"Occasional\", to \"Constant\". The next field is \"Converting others\", which asks the player to choose the level of effort the character puts into converting others to their beliefs. The choices here are \"Never\", \"Casual\", and \"Aggressive\". Finally, the \"Attitude\" field asks the player to choose the general approach the character takes towards religion and religious beliefs. The options for this field range from the irreverent \"Irreverent\" to the devout \"Ecstatic\". By filling out these fields, the player can gain a deeper understanding of their character's relationship to religion and spirituality. Expression of beliefs Converting others Attitude - None - Never - Irreverent - Occasional - Casual - Fearful - Constant - Aggressive - Judgmental - Humble - Ecstatic Religious association The \"Religious Association\" field in the character sheet is an important aspect of a character's spirituality. This field indicates the character's affiliation, or lack thereof, with a religious organization or belief system. There are a range of options available, including Church, Cult, Fellowship, Solitary, and Indigenous, each with its own unique meaning and characteristics. A Church is a well-established, hierarchical religious organization, typically with a set of beliefs and practices that are followed by its members. A Cult is a smaller group attached to a single charismatic leader, who may have unique or unconventional beliefs. A Fellowship is a small, informal religious group that lacks formal organization and a charismatic leader. Solitary is for characters who either have unique beliefs or choose not to affiliate with others, and Indigenous refers to religious traditions within a cultural group, such as a family or village. Having an understanding of a character's religious association can provide insight into their beliefs, values, and motivations, and can also add depth to their relationships with other characters. This field can also play a role in the story, as it may impact the character's actions and decisions, as well as influence how they are perceived by others. Term Definition Church A large, established, and hierarchical religious organization with a set of doctrines and practices. Cult A small or large group with a strong devotion to a single charismatic leader, often with unconventional beliefs and practices.

These roles range from leaders and spiritual advisors, to assistants and messengers, to protectors and mediators.

This field covers the specific rituals or practices that the character engages in, such as daily prayers or meditations, monthly celebrations or ceremonies, seasonal rituals, or life milestones. In addition to the type of ritual, this field may also include information on the frequency, location, and details of the ritual itself. For example, a character might participate in a monthly full moon ritual that involves offering incense, reciting prayers, and communing with their deity or spirit guide. By including this information, players can help to create a more vivid and immersive representation of their character's spirituality. Additionally, this information can also be used to drive roleplaying decisions, such as the character's reactions to certain situations or interactions with others.

These practices are often performed under the guidance of a shaman or spiritual leader and are considered sacred within some religious traditions. Group meditation or prayer sessions: Group meditation or prayer sessions involve a community of individuals coming together to meditate, pray, or perform other spiritual practices in unison.

Embracing the ethos of open source development, Eidos presents a combat system that is both immersive and accessible, catering to players of all skill levels. Turn Structure Every turn in Eidos is a symphony of action and consequence, where players and the DM contribute to the unfolding narrative: Player and NPC Actions : Each player and NPC writes down their intended action for the turn, whether it's a movement, an attack, or a strategic maneuver. Randomized Resolution : These actions are placed into a receptacle\u2014a cup, bowl, or electronic system of randomness. The DM then draws actions at random, mirroring the unpredictability of battle. Dice Rolls and Narration : As actions are drawn, the DM narrates the turn, rolling dice to determine the success of attacks and resulting injuries. A successful attack hinges on a Skill Roll, its difficulty influenced by factors such as armor, terrain advantage, and environmental conditions. Conflic Resolution Skill Roll for the Action : Each action undertaken by a player or NPC begins with a skill roll. The difficulty of this roll is meticulously weighted by the DM, considering factors such as armor strength, tactical advantage, and environmental conditions. Whether it's a calculated strike or a daring maneuver, success hinges on the mastery of the skill. Resolving Successful Attacks : Upon achieving success in an attack, the narrative unfolds with the roll of dice. The DM determines the extent of damage inflicted, weaving the outcome seamlessly into the ongoing tale. Every blow struck carries weight, leaving its mark on the combatants and shaping the course of the conflict. Responding to Failed Attacks : In the dance of combat, failure is but a stepping stone to opportunity. Should an attack falter, the defender seizes the moment, retaliating with a counter-attack of their own. The ebb and flow of battle are punctuated by these moments of reversal, where resilience and strategic prowess come to the fore. Diverse Actions, Varied Skills : Beyond the clash of steel , conflict in Eidos encompasses a spectrum of actions. From acrobatic leaps to cunning feints, every move is an opportunity for skill mastery. Each action undertaken\u2014be it jumping, rolling, or throwing\u2014is subject to the same scrutiny, resolved through the lens of skill and chance. Injury and Consequences Eidos introduces a realistic and detailed approach to injury, ensuring that every hit carries weight. When an attack lands, it's not merely a matter of dealing damage\u2014it's about determining the specific injury inflicted. Injury Tables Each attack's success prompts a roll on a corresponding injury table. For example, an attacker aims for a specific body part like the neck and successfully hits, the player rolls the \"Cutting in Neck Damage Table\" to determine the outcome. These tables define the consequences, ranging from minor wounds to severe trauma. Type of Damage Description Cutting Damage caused by sharp-edged weapons Stabbing Damage caused by piercing weapons Impact Damage from blunt force or crushing attacks Fire Damage from burns or heat sources Acid Damage from corrosive acids or chemicals Poison Damage caused by poison Fall Damage caused by falling from a tall place Body Part Description Head The uppermost part of the body Torso The

causing devastating injuries and leaving lasting scars. Whether from a raging inferno or a targeted spell, fire damage can result in a variety of effects, including: Burns : Characters may suffer from first-degree burns, causing pain and discomfort but relatively minor damage. More severe burns, such as second or third-degree burns, can lead to blistering, tissue damage, and long-term complications. Smoke Inhalation : In addition to direct flame exposure, individuals caught in fires may inhale smoke, leading to respiratory issues, coughing, and reduced lung function. Environmental Hazards : Fires can spread rapidly, creating hazardous conditions such as collapsing structures, intense heat, and limited visibility. Acid Acid poses a different set of challenges, corroding flesh, armor, and equipment with its caustic properties. When subjected to acid attacks, characters must contend with the following hazards: Types of Acid Damage Corrosive Burns : Acid eats away at organic and inorganic materials alike, causing painful burns and potentially permanent damage to skin, clothing, and gear. Armor Degradation : Protective armor may suffer from corrosion, compromising its integrity and reducing its effectiveness in defending against future attacks. Environmental Contamination : Pools of acid or acidic fumes can create hazardous environments, posing risks to both health and equipment. Poison Poison introduces a stealthy and insidious threat to adventurers, lurking in traps, tainted food, or the fangs of venomous creatures. Unlike conventional damage, poison affects its victims over time, gradually weakening their bodies and impairing their abilities. Types of Poison Contact Poison : Applied to weapons or surfaces, contact poisons require physical contact to take effect, such as through a poisoned blade or a booby-trapped object. Ingested Poison : Consumed through food or drink, ingested poisons target the digestive system, leading to nausea, vomiting, and systemic damage. Inhaled Poison : Released as gas or vapor, inhaled poisons affect the respiratory system, causing coughing, difficulty breathing, and potentially lethal asphyxiation. Injected Poison : Delivered via puncture wounds, injected poisons are typically associated with venomous creatures, such as snakes or spiders, and can induce paralysis, organ failure, or death. Instant Death and Recovery In some instances, the outcome of an attack can lead to instant death if the damage dealt is significant enough. Eidos doesn't shy away from the gravity of battle. For non-fatal injuries, a period of recovery follows. Players who emerge victorious or disengage from the conflict can recuperate over time. The aftermath of combat may leave scars or lingering effects, adding depth to your character's journey. The aftermath of combat extends beyond the battlefield. Players who survive are left to recover from their wounds, with lasting scars as tokens of their trials. The scars serve as reminders of battles fought, adding layers of realism and immersion to the world of Eidos. As you continue your exploration of this system, embrace the intricate interplay of choice, strategy, and chance that defines Eidos' unique combat and conflict resolution mechanics.","title":"Combat"},{"location":"8_combat/#combat-and-conflict-resolution","text":"In Eidos, combat transcends mere mechanical exchanges\u2014it's a dynamic narrative woven from the decisions of players and the capricious roll of dice. Embracing the ethos of open source development, Eidos presents a combat system that is both immersive and accessible, catering to players of all skill levels.","title":"Combat and Conflict Resolution"},{"location":"8_combat/#turn-structure","text":"Every turn in Eidos is a symphony of action and consequence, where players and the DM contribute to the unfolding narrative: Player and NPC Actions : Each player and NPC writes down their intended action for the turn, whether it's a movement, an attack, or a strategic maneuver. Randomized Resolution : These actions are placed into a receptacle\u2014a cup, bowl, or electronic system of randomness. The DM then draws actions at random, mirroring the unpredictability of battle. Dice Rolls and Narration : As actions are drawn, the DM narrates the turn, rolling dice to determine the success of attacks and resulting injuries. A successful attack hinges on a Skill Roll, its difficulty influenced by factors such as armor, terrain advantage, and environmental conditions.","title":"Turn Structure"},{"location":"8_combat/#conflic-resolution","text":"Skill Roll for the Action : Each action undertaken by a player or NPC begins with a skill roll. The difficulty of this roll is meticulously weighted by the DM, considering factors such as armor strength, tactical advantage, and environmental conditions. Whether it's a calculated strike or a daring maneuver, success hinges on the mastery of the skill. Resolving Successful Attacks : Upon achieving success in an attack, the narrative unfolds with the roll of dice. The DM determines the extent of damage inflicted, weaving the outcome seamlessly into the ongoing tale. Every blow struck carries weight, leaving its mark on the combatants and shaping the course of the conflict. Responding to Failed Attacks : In the dance of combat, failure is but a stepping stone to opportunity. Should an attack falter, the defender seizes the moment, retaliating with a counter-attack of their own. The ebb and flow of battle are punctuated by these moments of reversal, where resilience and strategic prowess come to the fore. Diverse Actions, Varied Skills : Beyond the clash of steel , conflict in Eidos encompasses a spectrum of actions. From acrobatic leaps to cunning feints, every move is an opportunity for skill mastery. Each action undertaken\u2014be it jumping, rolling, or throwing\u2014is subject to the same scrutiny, resolved through the lens of skill and chance.","title":"Conflic Resolution"},{"location":"8_combat/#injury-and-consequences","text":"Eidos introduces a realistic and detailed approach to injury, ensuring that every hit carries weight.

For example, an attacker aims for a specific body part like the neck and successfully hits, the player rolls the \"Cutting in Neck Damage Table\" to determine the outcome. These tables define the consequences, ranging from minor wounds to severe trauma. Type of Damage Description Cutting Damage caused by sharp-edged weapons Stabbing Damage caused by piercing weapons Impact Damage from blunt force or crushing attacks Fire Damage from burns or heat

Whether from a raging inferno or a targeted spell, fire damage can result in a variety of effects, including: Burns : Characters may suffer from first-degree burns, causing pain and discomfort but relatively minor damage. More severe burns, such as second or third-degree burns, can lead to blistering, tissue damage, and long-term complications. Smoke Inhalation : In addition to direct flame exposure, individuals caught in fires may inhale smoke, leading to respiratory issues, coughing, and reduced lung function. Environmental Hazards : Fires can spread rapidly, creating hazardous conditions such as collapsing structures, intense heat, and limited visibility.","title":"Fire"},{"location":"8_combat/#acid","text":"Acid poses a different set of challenges, corroding flesh, armor, and equipment with its caustic properties. When subjected to acid attacks, characters must contend with the following hazards: Types of Acid Damage Corrosive Burns : Acid eats away at organic and inorganic materials alike, causing painful burns and potentially permanent damage to skin, clothing, and gear. Armor Degradation : Protective armor may suffer from corrosion, compromising its integrity and reducing its effectiveness in defending against future attacks. Environmental Contamination : Pools of acid or acidic fumes can create hazardous environments, posing risks to both health and equipment.","title":"Acid"},{"location":"8_combat/#poison","text":"Poison introduces a stealthy and insidious threat to adventurers, lurking in traps, tainted food, or the fangs of venomous creatures. Unlike conventional damage, poison affects its victims over time, gradually weakening their bodies and impairing their abilities. Types of Poison Contact Poison : Applied to weapons or surfaces, contact poisons require physical contact to take effect, such as through a poisoned blade or a booby-trapped object. Ingested Poison : Consumed through food or drink, ingested poisons target the digestive system, leading to nausea, vomiting, and systemic damage. Inhaled Poison : Released as gas or vapor, inhaled poisons affect the respiratory system, causing coughing, difficulty breathing, and potentially lethal asphyxiation. Injected Poison : Delivered via puncture wounds, injected poisons are typically associated with venomous creatures, such as snakes or spiders, and can induce paralysis, organ failure, or death.","title":"Poison"},{"location":"8_combat/#instant-death-and-recovery","text":"In some instances, the outcome of an attack can lead to instant death if the damage dealt is significant enough. Eidos doesn't shy away from the gravity of battle. For non-fatal injuries, a period of recovery follows. Players who emerge victorious or disengage from the conflict can recuperate over time. The aftermath of combat may leave scars or lingering effects, adding depth to your character's journey. The aftermath of combat extends beyond the battlefield. Players who survive are left to recover from their wounds, with lasting scars as tokens of their trials. The scars serve as reminders of battles fought, adding layers of realism and immersion to the world of Eidos.
