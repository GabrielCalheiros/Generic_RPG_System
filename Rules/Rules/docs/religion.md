# Spirituality and Religion

![Image1](./img/religion01.svg)


In the world of role-playing games, it's important to consider the spirituality and religious beliefs of a character. The Spirituality Sheet is an integral part of character creation and is designed to help players define their character's connection to the spiritual and religious aspects of the game world. This chapter will detail the mechanics behind the Spirituality Sheet, including the options available for defining the strength of a character's belief or association with a religious system, as well as any relevant traits and skills that may impact the character's spirituality and religious beliefs. Whether playing as a devout follower of a particular faith or a non-believer, the Spirituality Sheet will help players bring their character to life and create a more immersive role-playing experience.

## Adherence

The "Adherence" field on the character sheet represents the strength of the character's belief or association with a particular religious or spiritual system. The options for this field range from non-believer to orthodox adherent, providing a spectrum of beliefs that a character can possess. The non-believer is someone who does not hold any belief in a higher power, whereas an agnostic is someone who is uncertain about the existence of a higher power. On the other hand, a casual adherent is someone who holds a loose connection to their religious or spiritual beliefs, and an orthodox adherent is someone who strictly follows the teachings and practices of their chosen system. This mechanic helps to further flesh out the character and their motivations, and provides a lens through which the character may view the world around them.

1.	Non-believer
2.	Agnostic
3.	Casual adherent
4.	Orthodox adherent

## Tolerance

This field reflects the character's willingness to accept differences of belief in others. In determining the level of tolerance, there are three options available for the player to choose from: Inclusive, Tolerant, or Intolerant. The level of tolerance selected will affect how the character interacts with people of different beliefs and religions in the game world.

1.	Inclusive
2.	Tolerant
3.	Intolerant

## Religious Demeanor

The field "RELIGIOUS DEMEANOR" on the character sheet aims to capture how your character tends to act in regards to religious beliefs. To reflect this, the player will be presented with three different fields to fill out. The first field is "Expression of beliefs" and asks the player to decide on the frequency at which their character expresses their beliefs. The options range from "None", "Occasional", to "Constant". The next field is "Converting others", which asks the player to choose the level of effort the character puts into converting others to their beliefs. The choices here are "Never", "Casual", and "Aggressive". Finally, the "Attitude" field asks the player to choose the general approach the character takes towards religion and religious beliefs. The options for this field range from the irreverent "Irreverent" to the devout "Ecstatic". By filling out these fields, the player can gain a deeper understanding of their character's relationship to religion and spirituality.

| Expression of beliefs | Converting others | Attitude     |
|-----------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| - None                | - Never           | - Irreverent |
| - Occasional          | - Casual          | - Fearful    |
| - Constant            | - Aggressive      | - Judgmental |
|                       |                   | - Humble     |
|                       |                   | - Ecstatic   |

## Religious association

The "Religious Association" field in the character sheet is an important aspect of a character's spirituality. This field indicates the character's affiliation, or lack thereof, with a religious organization or belief system. There are a range of options available, including Church, Cult, Fellowship, Solitary, and Indigenous, each with its own unique meaning and characteristics.

A Church is a well-established, hierarchical religious organization, typically with a set of beliefs and practices that are followed by its members. A Cult is a smaller group attached to a single charismatic leader, who may have unique or unconventional beliefs. A Fellowship is a small, informal religious group that lacks formal organization and a charismatic leader. Solitary is for characters who either have unique beliefs or choose not to affiliate with others, and Indigenous refers to religious traditions within a cultural group, such as a family or village.

Having an understanding of a character's religious association can provide insight into their beliefs, values, and motivations, and can also add depth to their relationships with other characters. This field can also play a role in the story, as it may impact the character's actions and decisions, as well as influence how they are perceived by others.

## Practices/Rituals:

This field covers the specific rituals or practices that the character engages in, such as daily prayers or meditations, monthly celebrations or ceremonies, seasonal rituals, or life milestones. In addition to the type of ritual, this field may also include information on the frequency, location, and details of the ritual itself. For example, a character might participate in a monthly full moon ritual that involves offering incense, reciting prayers, and communing with their deity or spirit guide. By including this information, players can help to create a more vivid and immersive representation of their character's spirituality. Additionally, this information can also be used to drive roleplaying decisions, such as the character's reactions to certain situations or interactions with others. Overall, the "Practices/Rituals" field is a valuable tool for creating well-rounded, believable characters with unique spiritual perspectives.

**Spiritual or Physical Purification Rituals:**

- Purification rituals can take many forms and serve different purposes, but they typically aim to cleanse the individual of negative energies or influences.
