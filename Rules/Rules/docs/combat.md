# Combat and Conflict Resolution

In Eidos, combat isn't just a mechanical exchange of blows, but a tapestry woven with your decisions and the roll of dice. In this chapter, we invite you to explore the very essence of conflict resolution, guiding you through the intricate dance of engagements, the strategic crossroads, and the unfolding narratives that arise from your choices.

## Introduction to Conflict

Before the first clash of weapons and the casting of spells, let us set the stage. Imagine a world brimming with anticipation, where the air crackles with tension, and the paths of adversaries converge. An introduction to conflict offers a glimpse into the impending struggle, framing the stakes, motives, and emotions that fuel the impending battle. With each player and foe poised on the precipice, the narrative emerges, waiting for you to seize its threads.

**Igniting Tension** - With an introduction in place, the atmosphere thickens as tension takes root. Feel the electricity in the air as combatants sense the imminent clash. Each decision, each skill chosen, becomes a brushstroke on the canvas of narrative possibilities. Like a composer orchestrating a symphony, you and your opponents add notes of anticipation, uncertainty, and strategy to the unfolding tale.

**Commencing the Engagement** - As the narrative crescendos, the combatants step onto the stage. Your character, armed with chosen skills, faces adversaries whose intents and actions are equally bound by fate and choice. Here, the flow of conflict hinges on the interplay of the dice—a roll of two six-sided dice (2d6) that will determine the outcome of your endeavors. Each move, a dance between your chosen skill and the roll of dice, shapes the progression of the battle.

**Unfolding the Duel** - With the dice cast and skills employed, the narrative springs to life. Attack and defense, choice and consequence—all are woven into the ebb and flow of the duel. The outcome of each interaction hinges on the harmony between skill rolls and dice results. The combatants, locked in a dance of fate and strategy, push the narrative forward with every exchange, every calculated move.

**Pivotal Decisions** - Amidst the exchanges of blows and parries, moments of significance emerge like beacons in the night. Critical hits and fumbles introduce unexpected turns, shifting the tide of battle with unforeseen outcomes. A choice to counterattack, a masterful spellcast, or even a momentary vulnerability—the narrative twists and turns with the dice, leaving you on the edge of your seat as the story unfolds.

**Culmination and Aftermath** - As the rhythm of combat reaches its crescendo, the climax draws near. The culmination of decisions and dice rolls casts the die for victory or retreat, triumph or setback. Wounds and triumphs, etched in the fabric of the narrative, linger as tokens of the struggle. Whether emerging victorious or stepping back to reassess, the aftermath of combat is marked by scars, lessons, and the ever-present narrative web.

**Continuing the Journey** - The tale never truly ends, even as the combat concludes. Decisions ripple outward, intertwining with character growth, relationships, and the overarching narrative. Each engagement becomes a brushstroke in the canvas of your character's journey, a testament to the choices you make and the dice you roll. So, let us journey deeper into the mechanisms that shape Eidos' combat, exploring skills, strategy, and the fluid interplay of dice and destiny.

In the pages that follow, we unravel the intricacies of Eidos' combat mechanics, guiding you through the art of engaging foes, mastering skills, and embracing the stories that emerge from the crucible of conflict.

## Narrative-Based Combat

In the realm of Eidos, combat takes on a narrative hue, weaving together the art of storytelling and the thrill of dice mechanics. This innovative combat system revolves around the choices you make and the roll of dice, aligning the stars of fate with the threads of your character's journey. Each turn unveils a canvas of possibilities as you select a skill that mirrors your intended action, connecting each move with a distinctive skill. Whether you're grasping the hilt of a blade, conjuring arcane spells, or channeling unique abilities, the skill you choose shapes the unfolding tale of the battle.

### Engaging Multiple Enemies

The battlefield is not always a solo stage; often, it hosts a symphony of adversaries. When you find yourself ensnared by the presence of multiple foes, the tempo of your strategy changes. Confronting two enemies necessitates an adaptive approach. Your conflict resolution becomes a dance of dice, as you roll two six-sided dice (2d6) for your adversaries and compare their combined roll against your own. The rhythm of battle is further seasoned by the capabilities of diverse non-human adversaries, some bearing more than a single six-sided die, reflecting their potency.

### Chained Events

Within the fluid tapestry of combat, each engagement initiates a cascade of actions that ripple through the battlefield. This entwined progression persists until one side emerges victorious or the combatants disengage, leaving behind the echoes of their decisions and rolls. Let's dive deeper into the rich dynamics of Eidos' combat by unraveling the chain of events in greater detail:

1. **Initiative Determination:** As the curtain rises on combat's stage, the question of initiative takes center stage. The dice of destiny roll, casting their vote on which side seizes the advantage first. Whether the combatants share an awareness of each other's intent or the shadows of uncertainty loom, the dice arbitrate this pivotal choice. Should both you and your opponent intend to attack, an additional roll of the dice commences, illuminating the starting player.

2. **Defensive Stance:** Amidst the whirlwind of conflict, you may opt to embrace a defensive stance, prioritizing prudence over aggression. This calculated path bestows upon you a defensive bonus of +2 to your roll, at the expense of forgoing an immediate attack. Your readiness to repel your adversary's advances transforms into a stalwart shield, lending you an edge as you confront incoming assaults.

3. **Initial Attack:** With initiative established and defensive strategies weighed, the stage is set for the opening gambit. This attack, a manifestation of your chosen skill bolstered by the roll of a six-sided die (1d6), heralds the prologue of the combat's intricate dance. The dice unfurl their secrets, deciding the fate of your strike—whether it pierces true or meets the staunch resistance of your adversary's defenses.

4. **Defensive Maneuvers:** The recipient of the initial attack, be it a successful hit that lands or a deft defense that parries, steps into the role of the defender. A repertoire of defensive maneuvers—parrying, dodging, strategic bracing—unfurls as tools in their arsenal. The dice once again ascend the stage, adjudicating the efficacy of these agile evasions.

5. **Counterattack and Retaliation:** A successful defense may breathe life into the flames of counterattack. The balance of battle shifts as the defender capitalizes on an opening, seeking to turn the tide with a retaliatory strike. The dice, bearing witness to the ever-shifting tides of fortune, unfurl the outcome—whether this counterattack lands with impactful force or merely grazes its intended mark.

6. **Unforeseen Interruptions:** Amidst the intricate choreography of blows and strategic defensive maneuvers, the stage permits for unexpected disruptions. Special abilities, moments of tactical insight, or the intervention of serendipitous fortune grant you the opportunity to break the rhythm of your opponent's actions. When you opt to interrupt, the impartial dice step forward to declare the verdict on the success of your strategic interference.

7. **Continued Sequences:** Within the ebb and flow of combat, a sequence of cascading actions unfolds. Each successful attack and resilient defense becomes a thread woven into the ongoing tapestry of battle. The dice roll, your chosen skill guides the path, and the rhythm of engagement persists—a true reflection of the fluid, dynamic nature of combat.

9. **Reckoning and Culmination:** With the interplay of attack, defense, and counterattack progressing, the narrative inches ever closer to its zenith. Wounds accumulate, strategies unfurl, and choices accrue momentum. Dice and destiny unite in a crescendo, marking a reckoning where the culmination of actions echoes through the clash, shaping the climax of battle.

10. **Post-Combat Reflection:** As the final dice tumble and the echoes of combat fade, the aftermath of battle assumes the spotlight. Wounds endured, tactics employed, choices etched—the ripples of combat extend beyond its cessation. Characters emerge from the fray transformed, their narratives further woven into the expansive fabric of the overarching story.

In Eidos, combat unfurls as a symphony of choices and dice, a dynamic ballet of strategy and fate. These chained events mirror the ebb and flow of battle, where every decision, every dice roll, and every interaction layers depth into your character's journey and the grand tapestry of the overarching narrative. Now, let us step onto the battlefield, where every footfall, every choice, reverberates through the continuum of conflict.


## Injury and Consequences

Eidos introduces a realistic and detailed approach to injury, ensuring that every hit carries weight. When an attack lands, it's not merely a matter of dealing damage—it's about determining the specific injury inflicted.

### Injury Tables

Each attack's success prompts a roll on a corresponding injury table. For example, an attacker aims for a specific body part like the neck and successfully hits, the player rolls the "Cutting in Neck Damage Table" to determine the outcome. These tables define the consequences, ranging from minor wounds to severe trauma.

### Instant Death and Recovery

In some instances, the outcome of an attack can lead to instant death if the damage dealt is significant enough. Eidos doesn't shy away from the gravity of battle.

For non-fatal injuries, a period of recovery follows. Players who emerge victorious or disengage from the conflict can recuperate over time. The aftermath of combat may leave scars or lingering effects, adding depth to your character's journey.

## Sample Combat Scenario

Let's step into the world of Eidos with a sample combat scenario:

1. Alice, a seasoned warrior, faces two foes: a cunning rogue and a fearsome orc. Both enemies possess their unique skills and dice.

2. Alice opts to attack the rogue with her sword. She rolls her skill and 2d6, achieving a total of 9.

3. The rogue's defense is surpassed, and Alice's attack hits. She consults the "Cutting in Torso Damage Table," rolling a 5.

4. The table reveals a deep cut that leaves the rogue bleeding. The rogue, in turn, counters with a swift strike, launching a counterattack chain.

5. The combat sequence unfolds, each action determining the subsequent move. Alice's choices and dice rolls shape the narrative, leading to either triumph or a strategic retreat.

Eidos embraces the complex web of combat narratives, dice rolls, and consequences. Through your choices and the luck of the dice, battles come alive, showcasing the depth of your character's journey and the ever-shifting outcomes of conflict.

## Recovery and Lasting Impact

The aftermath of combat extends beyond the battlefield. Players who survive are left to recover from their wounds, with lasting scars as tokens of their trials. The scars serve as reminders of battles fought, adding layers of realism and immersion to the world of Eidos.

As you continue your exploration of this system, embrace the intricate interplay of choice, strategy, and chance that defines Eidos' unique combat and conflict resolution mechanics.
