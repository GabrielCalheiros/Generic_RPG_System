# Combat and Conflict Resolution

![Image](./img/combat01.svg)

In Eidos, the combat is based on the ideas presented in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o5vWmoS3KU&ab_channel=SimplyWyvern). Basicly the combat needs to be a part of the narrative, not a mini-game that creates transitions in the game. So there is nothing of  initiative rolls nor anything like that. In the world of Eidos, combat is a dynamic and immersive experience that forms an integral part of the gameplay. Rooted in the principles of open-source development and designed to offer a deep narrative experience driven by player choice, Eidos sets itself apart as a unique addition to the tabletop role-playing genre. The combat system in Eidos is meticulously crafted to simulate realistic combat scenarios, with mechanics that emphasize tactical decision-making and narrative engagement.

## Turn Structure

Combat in Eidos follows a fluid turn structure, allowing for seamless interaction between players and the game master. Unlike traditional turn-based systems, Eidos prioritizes moment-to-moment decision-making, where players and the GM exchange actions and reactions in real-time. This approach enhances the narrative flow of combat scenes, fostering a sense of urgency and immersion.

## Conflic Resolution

Conflict resolution in Eidos is resolved through a combination of dice rolls and narrative storytelling. Players utilize a 2 20d roll to determine the outcome of their actions, with results influenced by their character's skills, abilities, and environmental factors. The DM adjudicates conflicts based on the narrative context, ensuring that combat encounters remain dynamic and unpredictable. 

| Difficulty        | Target Number |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Very easy         | 05            |
| Easy              | 10            |
| Moderate          | 15            |
| Difficult         | 20            |
| Hard              | 25            |
| Very hard         | 30            |
| Extremely hard    | 35            |
| Nearly impossible | 39            |

## Injury Tables

Each attack's success prompts a roll on a corresponding injury table. For example, an attacker aims for a specific body part like the neck and successfully hits, the player rolls the "Cutting in Neck Damage Table" to determine the outcome. These tables define the consequences, ranging from minor wounds to severe trauma.

### Fire

Fire is a potent force on the battlefield, capable of causing devastating injuries and leaving lasting scars. Whether from a raging inferno or a targeted spell, fire damage can result in a variety of effects, including:

- *Burns*: Characters may suffer from first-degree burns, causing pain and discomfort but relatively minor damage. More severe burns, such as second or third-degree burns, can lead to blistering, tissue damage, and long-term complications.
- *Smoke Inhalation*: In addition to direct flame exposure, individuals caught in fires may inhale smoke, leading to respiratory issues, coughing, and reduced lung function.
- *Environmental Hazards*: Fires can spread rapidly, creating hazardous conditions such as collapsing structures, intense heat, and limited visibility.

### Acid

Acid poses a different set of challenges, corroding flesh, armor, and equipment with its caustic properties. When subjected to acid attacks, characters must contend with the following hazards:

**Types of Acid Damage**

- *Corrosive Burns*: Acid eats away at organic and inorganic materials alike, causing painful burns and potentially permanent damage to skin, clothing, and gear.
- *Armor Degradation*: Protective armor may suffer from corrosion, compromising its integrity and reducing its effectiveness in defending against future attacks.
- *Environmental Contamination*: Pools of acid or acidic fumes can create hazardous environments, posing risks to both health and equipment.

### Poison

Poison introduces a stealthy and insidious threat to adventurers, lurking in traps, tainted food, or the fangs of venomous creatures. Unlike conventional damage, poison affects its victims over time, gradually weakening their bodies and impairing their abilities.

**Types of Poison**

- *Contact Poison*: Applied to weapons or surfaces, contact poisons require physical contact to take effect, such as through a poisoned blade or a booby-trapped object.
- *Ingested Poison*: Consumed through food or drink, ingested poisons target the digestive system, leading to nausea, vomiting, and systemic damage.
- *Inhaled Poison*: Released as gas or vapor, inhaled poisons affect the respiratory system, causing coughing, difficulty breathing, and potentially lethal asphyxiation.
- *Injected Poison*: Delivered via puncture wounds, injected poisons are typically associated with venomous creatures, such as snakes or spiders, and can induce paralysis, organ failure, or death.

### Instant Death and Recovery

In some instances, the outcome of an attack can lead to instant death if the damage dealt is significant enough. Eidos doesn't shy away from the gravity of battle.
For non-fatal injuries, a period of recovery follows. Players who emerge victorious or disengage from the conflict can recuperate over time. The aftermath of combat may leave scars or lingering effects, adding depth to your character's journey.

The aftermath of combat extends beyond the battlefield. Players who survive are left to recover from their wounds, with lasting scars as tokens of their trials. The scars serve as reminders of battles fought, adding layers of realism and immersion to the world of Eidos.
As you continue your exploration of this system, embrace the intricate interplay of choice, strategy, and chance that defines Eidos' unique combat and conflict resolution mechanics.
