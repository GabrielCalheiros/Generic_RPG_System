Determine the target number: This is the number that the player must roll equal to or higher than in order to succeed in their action. This target number can be determined by referring to the "Target Number Table," which takes into account factors such as the character's skill or attribute level, the difficulty of the action, and any bonuses or penalties that apply to the situation.

Roll the dice: The player rolls 2 six-sided dice and adds the results together.

Compare to target number: If the total result of the 2d6 roll is equal to or higher than the target number, the action is successful. If it's lower, the action fails.

Determine consequences: Depending on the situation, a successful or failed action can have different consequences. These consequences can be found in the "Consequences Table," which lists the outcomes of a successful or failed roll based on the situation. For example, a successful attack roll could result in damage being dealt to the target, while a failed roll could result in the attacker missing or stumbling.

This system allows for a range of possible outcomes, as the combination of two six-sided dice provides a number of possible results between 2 and 12. The target number can be adjusted to suit the difficulty of the action, ensuring that both easy and challenging tasks have a chance of success or failure. The Dungeon Master can refer to the "Target Number Table" and "Consequences Table" as needed to determine the outcome of any action."
