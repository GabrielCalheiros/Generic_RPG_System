    <h3>Part 1 - Personality</h3>
    <p>Most of this part will be based in the <a href="https://www.ashami.com/rpg/">Ash’s Guide to RPG Personality &
            Background</a>. Of course it its not a carbon copie, some modifications will be needed to fit his tables in
        the system. Anyway, credits must be given and you should check out his guide.</p>
    <h4>1.01 - Primary Motivators</h4>
    <p>The first step in crafting a character's personality is selecting their primary and secondary motivators. These
        motivations serve as the driving force behind a character's actions and decisions, shaping the narrative of
        their journey. The primary motivator is particularly important, as it acts as the primary catalyst for a
        character's backstory and personality. It is the underlying theme of a character's motivations, guiding their
        behavior and propelling them forward.
    </p>
    <p>When choosing these motivations, it's important to consider what your character wants most in the world. Is it
        wealth, power, love, revenge, or something else? By focusing on these motivations, players can ensure that their
        character's actions feel authentic and grounded in their personal desires. Whether facing challenges in combat
        or navigating complex social situations, characters driven by strong motivators will always have a clear
        direction and purpose.</p>

    <h4>1.02 - Dispositions</h4>
    <p>Disposition is an important aspect of character creation that provides depth and dimension to your character's
        personality. It allows you to understand how your character is likely to react emotionally to different
        situations, as well as how they appear to others. This trait helps you create a believable and relatable
        character, giving them an emotional landscape that makes sense within the context of the story.</p>
    <p> When determining your character's emotional disposition, it is important to keep in mind that it is not
        necessarily limiting. It simply provides a baseline for how your character is likely to feel at any given
        moment. A character with a predominantly cheerful disposition may still experience moments of sadness, anger, or
        anxiety, but they will be more likely to return to their cheerful state after those moments have passed.
    </p>
    <p> It is also important to note that emotional disposition should not be equated with alignment. A character's
        disposition can exist independently of their moral or ethical alignment, and it is possible for a character to
        be joyfully evil or angrily good. Understanding your character's disposition will help you make decisions about
        their emotional reactions, but it is just one aspect of the complex and multifaceted personality that you are
        creating.

        </tr>
    </table>

    <h4>1.03 - Moodiness</h4>
    <p>Moodiness is an important aspect of a character's personality and can greatly impact their behavior in different
        situations. A character who is labile, or quick to experience intense emotions, is likely to react strongly to
        the events happening around them. This can make them appear impulsive and prone to outbursts, but it can also
        add a level of excitement and unpredictability to their actions. On the other hand, a phlegmatic character, who
        is psychologically consistent and moderate, is likely to maintain their composure in even the most trying of
        situations. This calm demeanor can give them a sense of stability and reliability, but it can also make them
        appear uninterested or indifferent to the world around them.
    </p>
    <p> It is important to note that both moodiness traits have their own strengths and weaknesses, and they can greatly
        impact a character's relationships with other characters. For example, a labile character may be prone to
        jealousy or resentment, while a phlegmatic character may struggle with expressing their emotions effectively.
        Choosing the right moodiness trait for your character can help you build a more complete and well-rounded
        personality.
    </p>
    <p> Ultimately, the key to making a character's moodiness work for them is understanding the underlying motivations
        and dispositions that drive their behavior. Whether your character is quick to experience intense emotions or
        stays calm and collected in the face of adversity, the key is to make sure that their moodiness feels true to
        who they are as a character. By incorporating moodiness into your character's personality, you can add depth and
        richness to your role-playing experience and help bring your character to life on the tabletop.

    <h4>1.04 - Outlook</h4>
    <p>The concept of outlook is an important aspect of character creation as it defines the basic worldview of a
        character and helps determine their overall view of the world around them. This trait can greatly influence the
        choices that a character makes and the way they interact with others. A character with a positive outlook is
        likely to see the good in people and situations, while a character with a negative outlook is likely to be more
        skeptical and pessimistic. Understanding a character's outlook is key to understanding their motivations and how
        they may react in different situations. It is important to note that a character's outlook does not dictate
        their alignment, as a character can have a positive outlook but still make morally questionable decisions. This
        trait helps to add depth and complexity to a character, making them feel more real and unique.</p>

        <div class="right_side">

        </div>
    </div>

    <h4>1.05 - Integrity</h4>
    <p>Integrity refers to the values that guide a character's behavior in work and social interactions. When creating a
        character, players can choose between two options that embody different qualities and tendencies. The first
        option is "Conscientious", which represents being industrious, honest, responsible, meticulous, and pragmatic.
        On the other hand, the second option is "Unscrupulous", which embodies being lazy, deceitful, unreliable,
        manipulative, slipshod, and impractical. These two options serve as a starting point for players to develop
        their character's personality and decision-making. The choice of integrity will play a crucial role in
        determining a character's motivations and actions, influencing the character's interactions with others and the
        events of the story.</p>
    <div class="two_sided_table">
        <div class="right_side">
            <p><strong>1. Conscientious</strong> </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">Industrious, honest, responsible, meticulous, pragmatic</p>
        </div>
        <div class="left_side">
            <p><strong>2. Unscrupulous</strong> </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">Lazy, deceitful, unreliable, manipulative, slipshod, impractical</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h4>1.06 - Impulsiveness</h4>
    <p>The next aspect of character creation to consider is impulsiveness. This trait refers to a character's ability to
        regulate their thoughts and actions. Players must choose between two options: controlled or spontaneous. A
        controlled character is deliberate, focused, steady, and thoughtful. They carefully consider their decisions and
        think before they act. On the other hand, a spontaneous character is capricious, flighty, hyperactive, and rash.
        They are quick to act without thinking through the consequences of their actions. It's important to consider
        impulsiveness as it can greatly impact the way a character approaches situations and reacts to stimuli. A
        controlled character may be more reliable and level-headed, while a spontaneous character may be more
        unpredictable and exciting. Ultimately, the choice of impulsiveness helps to round out a character's personality
        and inform their behavior. </p>

            <p><strong>1. Controlled</strong> </p>

        <div class="left_side">
            <p><strong>2. Spontaneous</strong> </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">Capricious, flighty, hyperactive, rash</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h4>1.07 - Boldness</h4>
    <p>When it comes to creating a character's personality, it is important to consider their boldness, or willingness
        to face danger and enter into battle. This trait can greatly impact how a character approaches conflict and
        adversity, and can inform their actions and decisions in high-pressure situations. There are two main options
        for this characteristic: intrepid and cautious.</p>
    <p>
        Intrepid characters are daring, reckless, and valorous. They have a confident demeanor and are not easily
        intimidated by danger. They are known for their bravery and audacity in the face of adversity, and are often
        seen as leaders in combat situations. On the other hand, cautious characters are timid, paranoid, and vigilant.
        They are nervous and tentative in the face of danger, preferring to assess the situation before making a move.
        They are not as quick to jump into action, but their carefulness can often lead to a more strategic approach to
        conflict.</p>

    <h4>1.08 - Agreeableness</h4>
    <p>The sub-topic of "Agreeableness" deals with a character's overall attitude towards others and their ability to
        handle interpersonal conflicts and new situations. This trait is particularly important in shaping a character's
        behavior in social interactions and their ability to navigate challenging circumstances. A character who is
        described as "Agreeable" is warm, empathetic, and open-minded, possessing qualities such as tolerance,
        forgiveness, and adaptability. On the other hand, a character who is described as "Disagreeable" is cold and
        rigid, possessing traits such as tension, intractability, and narrow-mindedness. Understanding a character's
        level of agreeableness can give insight into how they are likely to respond in social and interpersonal
        situations.

        </div>
    </div>

    <h4>1.09 - Interactivity</h4>
    <p>The next sub-topic in character creation is Interactivity, which deals with the way your character interacts with
        others. This aspect of personality is crucial in shaping the character's social relationships and determining
        how they engage with the world around them. The table of choices in Interactivity includes two options: Engaging
        and Reserved. An Engaging character is often talkative, candid, and touchy, while a Reserved character is
        usually shy, preferring to keep to themselves and be more reserved in their interactions. Understanding this
        aspect of your character will greatly enhance the depth of your role-playing experience and allow you to build
        compelling, engaging stories.</p>
    <div class="two_sided_table">
        <div class="right_side">
            <p><strong>1. Engaging</strong> </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">Talkative, candid, entertaining, touchy</p>

        <div class="left_side">
            <p><strong>2. Reserved</strong> </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">Shy, loner, taciturn, evasive, cryptic</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h4>1.10 - Conformity</h4>
    <p>Conformity is an important aspect of a character's personality, determining their relationship with cultural
        norms and societal expectations. A character who is conventional is likely to follow orthodox beliefs and
        practices, be formal in their demeanor, and adhere to mainstream customs. On the other hand, a character who is
        heterodox may be rebellious in nature, have a creative and artistic streak, and may be known for their
        freethinking and exotic choices. Understanding a character's conformity can give insight into how they view and
        interact with the world around them.</p>
    <div class="two_sided_table">
        <div class="right_side">
            <p><strong>1. Conventional</strong> </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">Orthodox, formal, down-to-earth, mainstream, traditional </p>
        </div>
        <div class="left_side">
            <p><strong>2. Heterodox</strong> </p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <h4>1.11 - Sense of Humor</h4>

    <p>Sense of Humor is an important aspect of a character's personality and can be used to show their humor
        preferences and how they might react in different situations. It ranges from crude humor to dry wit and includes
        various styles such as slapstick, jokey, cynical, prankster, mean-spirited, gleeful, and surreal. By selecting
        one of these options, you can help to define your character's sense of humor and how they might react in
        different situations. Having a strong sense of humor can also be a way for your character to diffuse tense
        situations, and can be used to show their lighter side. Ultimately, your character's sense of humor is a tool
        that you can use to further develop their personality and bring them to life in your storytelling.</p>

    <h4>1.12 - Quirks, Habits, and Oddities</h4>
    <p>To help bring your character to life and add depth to gameplay, consider incorporating small quirks, habits, and
        oddities into their personality. These unique behavioral characteristics can range from relatively harmless
        habits, such as humming or lip biting, to more engaging and potentially entertaining quirks such as
        exhibitionism or sleepwalking. By adding these small but meaningful details to your character, you can bring
        them to life in a way that sets them apart from the rest of the party.</p>

    <p>These quirks, habits, and oddities can offer a multitude of role-playing opportunities. They can help flesh out a
        character's backstory, provide unique challenges or benefits during gameplay, and even influence the way they
        interact with other characters. For example, a character who is a compulsive liar may struggle with building
        trust with others, while a character who is an animal hater may have trouble working with characters who have
        animal companions. Whether you choose to focus on the more harmless or more engaging quirks, incorporating these
        small behaviors into your character can greatly enhance your role-playing experience.</p>

    <h4>1.13 - Mental Disorders</h4>
    <p>In this RPG system, we aim to provide an accurate representation of human mental and emotional disorders. While
        we understand that not all players may want their character to struggle with such issues, it does present an

        disorders to non-player characters, adding depth and complexity to the game world. It's important to note that the
