	<h3>Part 1 - Personality</h3>
	<p>Most of this part will be based in the <a href="https://www.ashami.com/rpg/">Ash’s Guide to RPG Personality &
			Background</a>. Of course it its not a carbon copie, some modifications will be needed to fit his tables in
		the system. Anyway, credits must be given and you should check out his guide.</p>
	<h4>1.01 - Primary Motivators</h4>
	<p>The first step in crafting a character's personality is selecting their primary and secondary motivators. These
		motivations serve as the driving force behind a character's actions and decisions, shaping the narrative of
		their journey. The primary motivator is particularly important, as it acts as the primary catalyst for a
		character's backstory and personality. It is the underlying theme of a character's motivations, guiding their
		behavior and propelling them forward.
	</p>
	<p>When choosing these motivations, it's important to consider what your character wants most in the world. Is it
		wealth, power, love, revenge, or something else? By focusing on these motivations, players can ensure that their
		character's actions feel authentic and grounded in their personal desires. Whether facing challenges in combat
		or navigating complex social situations, characters driven by strong motivators will always have a clear
		direction and purpose.</p>

	<h4>1.02 - Dispositions</h4>
	<p>Disposition is an important aspect of character creation that provides depth and dimension to your character's
		personality. It allows you to understand how your character is likely to react emotionally to different
		situations, as well as how they appear to others. This trait helps you create a believable and relatable
		character, giving them an emotional landscape that makes sense within the context of the story.</p>
	<p> When determining your character's emotional disposition, it is important to keep in mind that it is not
		necessarily limiting. It simply provides a baseline for how your character is likely to feel at any given
		moment. A character with a predominantly cheerful disposition may still experience moments of sadness, anger, or
		anxiety, but they will be more likely to return to their cheerful state after those moments have passed.
	</p>
	<p> It is also important to note that emotional disposition should not be equated with alignment. A character's
		disposition can exist independently of their moral or ethical alignment, and it is possible for a character to
		be joyfully evil or angrily good. Understanding your character's disposition will help you make decisions about
		their emotional reactions, but it is just one aspect of the complex and multifaceted personality that you are
		creating.
	</p>

	<h4>1.03 - Moodiness</h4>
	<p>Moodiness is an important aspect of a character's personality and can greatly impact their behavior in different
		situations. A character who is labile, or quick to experience intense emotions, is likely to react strongly to
		the events happening around them. This can make them appear impulsive and prone to outbursts, but it can also
		add a level of excitement and unpredictability to their actions. On the other hand, a phlegmatic character, who
		is psychologically consistent and moderate, is likely to maintain their composure in even the most trying of
		situations. This calm demeanor can give them a sense of stability and reliability, but it can also make them
		appear uninterested or indifferent to the world around them.
	</p>
	<p> It is important to note that both moodiness traits have their own strengths and weaknesses, and they can greatly
		impact a character's relationships with other characters. For example, a labile character may be prone to
		jealousy or resentment, while a phlegmatic character may struggle with expressing their emotions effectively.
		Choosing the right moodiness trait for your character can help you build a more complete and well-rounded
		personality.
	</p>
	<p> Ultimately, the key to making a character's moodiness work for them is understanding the underlying motivations
		and dispositions that drive their behavior. Whether your character is quick to experience intense emotions or
		stays calm and collected in the face of adversity, the key is to make sure that their moodiness feels true to
		who they are as a character. By incorporating moodiness into your character's personality, you can add depth and
		richness to your role-playing experience and help bring your character to life on the tabletop.

	<h4>1.04 - Outlook</h4>
	<p>The concept of outlook is an important aspect of character creation as it defines the basic worldview of a
		character and helps determine their overall view of the world around them. This trait can greatly influence the
		choices that a character makes and the way they interact with others. A character with a positive outlook is
		likely to see the good in people and situations, while a character with a negative outlook is likely to be more
		skeptical and pessimistic. Understanding a character's outlook is key to understanding their motivations and how
		they may react in different situations. It is important to note that a character's outlook does not dictate
		their alignment, as a character can have a positive outlook but still make morally questionable decisions. This
		trait helps to add depth and complexity to a character, making them feel more real and unique.</p>
	<div class="two_sided_table">
		<div class="right_side">
			<p><strong>1. Optimistic</strong> </p>
			<p style="font-style: italic;">Idealistic, confident, trusting, hopeful, upbeat</p>
		</div>
		<div class="left_side">
			<p><strong>2. Pessimistic</strong> </p>
			<p style="font-style: italic;">Cynical, bleak, distrustful, foreboding, resigned</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<h4>1.05 - Integrity</h4>
	<p>Integrity refers to the values that guide a character's behavior in work and social interactions. When creating a
		character, players can choose between two options that embody different qualities and tendencies. The first
		option is "Conscientious", which represents being industrious, honest, responsible, meticulous, and pragmatic.
		On the other hand, the second option is "Unscrupulous", which embodies being lazy, deceitful, unreliable,
		manipulative, slipshod, and impractical. These two options serve as a starting point for players to develop
		their character's personality and decision-making. The choice of integrity will play a crucial role in
		determining a character's motivations and actions, influencing the character's interactions with others and the
		events of the story.</p>
	<div class="two_sided_table">
		<div class="right_side">
			<p><strong>1. Conscientious</strong> </p>
			<p style="font-style: italic;">Industrious, honest, responsible, meticulous, pragmatic</p>
		</div>
		<div class="left_side">
			<p><strong>2. Unscrupulous</strong> </p>
			<p style="font-style: italic;">Lazy, deceitful, unreliable, manipulative, slipshod, impractical</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<h4>1.06 - Impulsiveness</h4>
	<p>The next aspect of character creation to consider is impulsiveness. This trait refers to a character's ability to
		regulate their thoughts and actions. Players must choose between two options: controlled or spontaneous. A
		controlled character is deliberate, focused, steady, and thoughtful. They carefully consider their decisions and
		think before they act. On the other hand, a spontaneous character is capricious, flighty, hyperactive, and rash.
		They are quick to act without thinking through the consequences of their actions. It's important to consider
		impulsiveness as it can greatly impact the way a character approaches situations and reacts to stimuli. A
		controlled character may be more reliable and level-headed, while a spontaneous character may be more
		unpredictable and exciting. Ultimately, the choice of impulsiveness helps to round out a character's personality
		and inform their behavior. </p>
	<div class="two_sided_table">
		<div class="right_side">
			<p><strong>1. Controlled</strong> </p>
			<p style="font-style: italic;">Deliberate, focused, steady, thoughtful </p>
		</div>
		<div class="left_side">
			<p><strong>2. Spontaneous</strong> </p>
			<p style="font-style: italic;">Capricious, flighty, hyperactive, rash</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<h4>1.07 - Boldness</h4>
	<p>When it comes to creating a character's personality, it is important to consider their boldness, or willingness
		to face danger and enter into battle. This trait can greatly impact how a character approaches conflict and
		adversity, and can inform their actions and decisions in high-pressure situations. There are two main options
		for this characteristic: intrepid and cautious.</p>
	<p>
		Intrepid characters are daring, reckless, and valorous. They have a confident demeanor and are not easily
		intimidated by danger. They are known for their bravery and audacity in the face of adversity, and are often
		seen as leaders in combat situations. On the other hand, cautious characters are timid, paranoid, and vigilant.
		They are nervous and tentative in the face of danger, preferring to assess the situation before making a move.
		They are not as quick to jump into action, but their carefulness can often lead to a more strategic approach to
		conflict.</p>
	<div class="two_sided_table">
		<div class="right_side">
			<p><strong>1. Intrepid</strong> </p>
			<p style="font-style: italic;">Daring, reckless, valorous, dauntless, audacious, confident </p>
		</div>
		<div class="left_side">
			<p><strong>2. Cautious</strong> </p>
			<p style="font-style: italic;">Timid, paranoid, vigilant, nervous, tentative</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<h4>1.08 - Agreeableness</h4>
	<p>The sub-topic of "Agreeableness" deals with a character's overall attitude towards others and their ability to
		handle interpersonal conflicts and new situations. This trait is particularly important in shaping a character's
		behavior in social interactions and their ability to navigate challenging circumstances. A character who is
		described as "Agreeable" is warm, empathetic, and open-minded, possessing qualities such as tolerance,
		forgiveness, and adaptability. On the other hand, a character who is described as "Disagreeable" is cold and
		rigid, possessing traits such as tension, intractability, and narrow-mindedness. Understanding a character's
		level of agreeableness can give insight into how they are likely to respond in social and interpersonal
		situations.
	</p>
	<div class="two_sided_table">
		<div class="right_side">
			<p><strong>1. Agreeable</strong> </p>
			<p style="font-style: italic;">Warm, empathic, tolerant, forgiving, open-minded, adaptable, altruistic </p>
		</div>
		<div class="left_side">
			<p><strong>2. Disagreeable</strong> </p>
			<p style="font-style: italic;">Cold, rigid, tense, intractable, narrow-minded, cantankerous, stingy </p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<h4>1.09 - Interactivity</h4>
	<p>The next sub-topic in character creation is Interactivity, which deals with the way your character interacts with
		others. This aspect of personality is crucial in shaping the character's social relationships and determining
		how they engage with the world around them. The table of choices in Interactivity includes two options: Engaging
		and Reserved. An Engaging character is often talkative, candid, and touchy, while a Reserved character is
		usually shy, preferring to keep to themselves and be more reserved in their interactions. Understanding this
		aspect of your character will greatly enhance the depth of your role-playing experience and allow you to build
		compelling, engaging stories.</p>
	<div class="two_sided_table">
		<div class="right_side">
			<p><strong>1. Engaging</strong> </p>
			<p style="font-style: italic;">Talkative, candid, entertaining, touchy</p>
		</div>
		<div class="left_side">
			<p><strong>2. Reserved</strong> </p>
			<p style="font-style: italic;">Shy, loner, taciturn, evasive, cryptic</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<h4>1.10 - Conformity</h4>
	<p>Conformity is an important aspect of a character's personality, determining their relationship with cultural
		norms and societal expectations. A character who is conventional is likely to follow orthodox beliefs and
		practices, be formal in their demeanor, and adhere to mainstream customs. On the other hand, a character who is
		heterodox may be rebellious in nature, have a creative and artistic streak, and may be known for their
		freethinking and exotic choices. Understanding a character's conformity can give insight into how they view and
		interact with the world around them.</p>
	<div class="two_sided_table">
		<div class="right_side">
			<p><strong>1. Conventional</strong> </p>
			<p style="font-style: italic;">Orthodox, formal, down-to-earth, mainstream, traditional </p>
		</div>
		<div class="left_side">
			<p><strong>2. Heterodox</strong> </p>
			<p style="font-style: italic;">Rebellious, arty, shocking, freethinking, exotic</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<img src="./images/character_creation_3.svg" class="imgCenter" style="width: -webkit-fill-available;">

	<h4>1.11 - Sense of Humor</h4>

	<p>Sense of Humor is an important aspect of a character's personality and can be used to show their humor
		preferences and how they might react in different situations. It ranges from crude humor to dry wit and includes
		various styles such as slapstick, jokey, cynical, prankster, mean-spirited, gleeful, and surreal. By selecting
		one of these options, you can help to define your character's sense of humor and how they might react in
		different situations. Having a strong sense of humor can also be a way for your character to diffuse tense
		situations, and can be used to show their lighter side. Ultimately, your character's sense of humor is a tool
		that you can use to further develop their personality and bring them to life in your storytelling.</p>

	<h4>1.12 - Favorite Topics of Conversation </h4>
	<p>One helpful way to bring depth to your character is to determine what they like to talk about in casual social
		situations. People are naturally inclined to talk about things they are skilled in or have a personal interest
		in, and this is an easy way to help flesh out your character. By examining your character's skills, hobbies,
		training, and background, you can start to determine what topics they might be passionate about. This
		information can be used to create a more complete picture of who your character is and how they interact with
		others in social situations. By giving your character a few key topics they like to discuss, you can help bring
		them to life and make them more memorable to other players.</p>
