<h1 id="presentation">Presentation</h1>
<p>In the realm of tabletop role-playing games, Eidos stands as a unique and innovative addition to the genre. Rooted in the principles of open source development, this game is designed to be both immersive and accessible, offering a deep and rich narrative experience that is driven by player choice.  Eidos takes its name from the ancient Greek concept of the world of ideas, reflecting the game's focus on immersive and thought-provoking narratives. This name is a nod to the idea that in role-playing games, players have the ability to explore and interact with an imagined world filled with endless possibilities.</p>
<p>The character creation process in Eidos is a deep and engaging experience, allowing players to build their characters from the ground up. With character sheets devoted to personality, religion, physical description, background, clothing, equipment, and skills, players have the tools to create a truly unique and memorable character.</p>
<p>The combat system in Eidos is designed to be immersive and engaging, with mechanics that are designed to create dynamic and exciting combat scenes. The game's mechanics are based on classic combat narratives, and the system strives to be a simulation of combat rather than simply a turn-based dice-rolling game. The standard rules are designed to be played in a pre-modern low-fantasy setting, but the game is easily adaptable to other role-playing scenarios.</p>
<p>This rulebook is divided into six chapters, each of which covers a different aspect of the game. Chapter 1: Character Creation provides a detailed guide to creating your character, including sections on personality, religion, physical description, background, clothing, equipment, and skills. Chapter 2: Combat and Combat Resolution covers the mechanics of combat in Eidos, including basic combat mechanics, ability checks, skills, tactical maneuvering, environmental interaction, morale, reinforcements, ranged combat, unarmed combat, weapon mechanics, grappling, healing, shields and armor, mounted combat, naval combat, aerial combat, siege weapons, traps, stealth, mass combat, and death and dying.</p>
<p><img alt="Image1" src="./images/index02.svg" /></p>
<p>Chapter 3: Survival Mechanics covers the mechanics of survival in Eidos, including food and water requirements, shelter, scavenging, travel, and exploration. Chapter 4: Character Injuries and Health provides a comprehensive guide to character injuries and health, including damage and wound mechanics, healing and recovery, status effects, and advanced injuries and trauma.</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Game Master Tools provides a guide to running Eidos games, including world-building, NPC generation, encounters, group dynamics, movement and travel, encounter generation, and campaign management. Chapter 6: Optional Rules and Variants covers alternative systems for combat, magic, and skills, as well as advanced mechanics for character development and progression and rules for playing in different settings and genres.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Eidos is an open source tabletop RPG system that offers a unique and engaging narrative experience, with mechanics that are designed to create immersive and exciting combat scenes. With its deep character creation process, engaging combat mechanics, and comprehensive survival mechanics, Eidos is a game that offers endless possibilities for players to explore and experience.</p>

<p>Most of this part will be based in the <a href="https://www.ashami.com/rpg/">Ash’s Guide to RPG Personality &amp; Background</a>. Of course it its not a carbon copie, some modifications will be needed to fit his tables in the system. Anyway, credits must be given and you should check out his guide.</p>
<h2 id="primary-motivators">Primary Motivators</h2>
<p>The first step in crafting a character's personality is selecting their primary and secondary motivators. These motivations serve as the driving force behind a character's actions and decisions, shaping the narrative of their journey. The primary motivator is particularly important, as it acts as the primary catalyst for a character's backstory and personality. It is the underlying theme of a character's motivations, guiding their behavior and propelling them forward.</p>
<p>When choosing these motivations, it's important to consider what your character wants most in the world. Is it wealth, power, love, revenge, or something else? By focusing on these motivations, players can ensure that their character's actions feel authentic and grounded in their personal desires. Whether facing challenges in combat or navigating complex social situations, characters driven by strong motivators will always have a clear direction and purpose.</p>

<h2 id="dispositions">Dispositions</h2>
<p>Disposition is an important aspect of character creation that provides depth and dimension to your character's personality. It allows you to understand how your character is likely to react emotionally to different situations, as well as how they appear to others. This trait helps you create a believable and relatable character, giving them an emotional landscape that makes sense within the context of the story.</p>
<p>When determining your character's emotional disposition, it is important to keep in mind that it is not necessarily limiting. It simply provides a baseline for how your character is likely to feel at any given moment. A character with a predominantly cheerful disposition may still experience moments of sadness, anger, or anxiety, but they will be more likely to return to their cheerful state after those moments have passed.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that emotional disposition should not be equated with alignment. A character's disposition can exist independently of their moral or ethical alignment, and it is possible for a character to be joyfully evil or angrily good. Understanding your character's disposition will help you make decisions about their emotional reactions, but it is just one aspect of the complex and multifaceted personality that you are creating.</p>
<ol>
<li>Joyful</li>
<li>Anxious</li>
<li>Melancholy</li>
<li>Curious</li>
<li>Calm</li>
<li>Angry</li>
<li>Contemptuous</li>
<li>Excited</li>
<li>Apathetic</li>
<li>Ashamed</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="moodiness">Moodiness</h2>
<p>Moodiness is an important aspect of a character's personality and can greatly impact their behavior in different situations. A character who is labile, or quick to experience intense emotions, is likely to react strongly to the events happening around them. This can make them appear impulsive and prone to outbursts, but it can also add a level of excitement and unpredictability to their actions. On the other hand, a phlegmatic character, who is psychologically consistent and moderate, is likely to maintain their composure in even the most trying of situations. This calm demeanor can give them a sense of stability and reliability, but it can also make them appear uninterested or indifferent to the world around them.</p>
<p>It is important to note that both moodiness traits have their own strengths and weaknesses, and they can greatly impact a character's relationships with other characters. For example, a labile character may be prone to jealousy or resentment, while a phlegmatic character may struggle with expressing their emotions effectively. Choosing the right moodiness trait for your character can help you build a more complete and well-rounded personality.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the key to making a character's moodiness work for them is understanding the underlying motivations and dispositions that drive their behavior. Whether your character is quick to experience intense emotions or stays calm and collected in the face of adversity, the key is to make sure that their moodiness feels true to who they are as a character. By incorporating moodiness into your character's personality, you can add depth and richness to your role-playing experience and help bring your character to life on the tabletop.</p>

<li>Labile</li>
<li>Even-tempered</li>
<li>Phlegmatic</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Image1" src="./images/personality03.svg" /></p>
<h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2>
<p>The concept of outlook is an important aspect of character creation as it defines the basic worldview of a character and helps determine their overall view of the world around them. This trait can greatly influence the choices that a character makes and the way they interact with others. A character with a positive outlook is likely to see the good in people and situations, while a character with a negative outlook is likely to be more skeptical and pessimistic. Understanding a character's outlook is key to understanding their motivations and how they may react in different situations. It is important to note that a character's outlook does not dictate their alignment, as a character can have a positive outlook but still make morally questionable decisions. This trait helps to add depth and complexity to a character, making them feel more real and unique.</p>

<h2 id="integrity">Integrity</h2>
<p>Integrity refers to the values that guide a character's behavior in work and social interactions. When creating a character, players can choose between two options that embody different qualities and tendencies. The first option is "Conscientious", which represents being industrious, honest, responsible, meticulous, and pragmatic. On the other hand, the second option is "Unscrupulous", which embodies being lazy, deceitful, unreliable, manipulative, slipshod, and impractical. These two options serve as a starting point for players to develop their character's personality and decision-making. The choice of integrity will play a crucial role in determining a character's motivations and actions, influencing the character's interactions with others and the events of the story.</p>

<h2 id="impulsiveness">Impulsiveness</h2>
<p>The next aspect of character creation to consider is impulsiveness. This trait refers to a character's ability to regulate their thoughts and actions. Players must choose between two options: controlled or spontaneous. A controlled character is deliberate, focused, steady, and thoughtful. They carefully consider their decisions and think before they act. On the other hand, a spontaneous character is capricious, flighty, hyperactive, and rash. They are quick to act without thinking through the consequences of their actions. It's important to consider impulsiveness as it can greatly impact the way a character approaches situations and reacts to stimuli. A controlled character may be more reliable and level-headed, while a spontaneous character may be more unpredictable and exciting. Ultimately, the choice of impulsiveness helps to round out a character's personality and inform their behavior.</p>

<h2 id="boldness">Boldness</h2>
<p>When it comes to creating a character's personality, it is important to consider their boldness, or willingness to face danger and enter into battle. This trait can greatly impact how a character approaches conflict and adversity, and can inform their actions and decisions in high-pressure situations. There are two main options for this characteristic: intrepid and cautious.</p>
<p>Intrepid characters are daring, reckless, and valorous. They have a confident demeanor and are not easily intimidated by danger. They are known for their bravery and audacity in the face of adversity, and are often seen as leaders in combat situations. On the other hand, cautious characters are timid, paranoid, and vigilant. They are nervous and tentative in the face of danger, preferring to assess the situation before making a move. They are not as quick to jump into action, but their carefulness can often lead to a more strategic approach to conflict.</p>

<h2 id="agreeableness">Agreeableness</h2>
<p>The sub-topic of "Agreeableness" deals with a character's overall attitude towards others and their ability to handle interpersonal conflicts and new situations. This trait is particularly important in shaping a character's behavior in social interactions and their ability to navigate challenging circumstances. A character who is described as "Agreeable" is warm, empathetic, and open-minded, possessing qualities such as tolerance, forgiveness, and adaptability. On the other hand, a character who is described as "Disagreeable" is cold and rigid, possessing traits such as tension, intractability, and narrow-mindedness. Understanding a character's level of agreeableness can give insight into how they are likely to respond in social and interpersonal situations.</p>

<h2 id="interactivity">Interactivity</h2>
<p>The next sub-topic in character creation is Interactivity, which deals with the way your character interacts with others. This aspect of personality is crucial in shaping the character's social relationships and determining how they engage with the world around them. The table of choices in Interactivity includes two options: Engaging and Reserved. An Engaging character is often talkative, candid, and touchy, while a Reserved character is usually shy, preferring to keep to themselves and be more reserved in their interactions. Understanding this aspect of your character will greatly enhance the depth of your role-playing experience and allow you to build compelling, engaging stories.</p>

<h2 id="conformity">Conformity</h2>
<p>Conformity is an important aspect of a character's personality, determining their relationship with cultural norms and societal expectations. A character who is conventional is likely to follow orthodox beliefs and practices, be formal in their demeanor, and adhere to mainstream customs. On the other hand, a character who is heterodox may be rebellious in nature, have a creative and artistic streak, and may be known for their freethinking and exotic choices. Understanding a character's conformity can give insight into how they view and interact with the world around them.</p>

<h2 id="quirks-habits-and-oddities">Quirks, Habits, and Oddities</h2>
<p>To help bring your character to life and add depth to gameplay, consider incorporating small quirks, habits, and oddities into their personality. These unique behavioral characteristics can range from relatively harmless habits, such as humming or lip biting, to more engaging and potentially entertaining quirks such as exhibitionism or sleepwalking. By adding these small but meaningful details to your character, you can bring them to life in a way that sets them apart from the rest of the party.</p>
<p>These quirks, habits, and oddities can offer a multitude of role-playing opportunities. They can help flesh out a character's backstory, provide unique challenges or benefits during gameplay, and even influence the way they interact with other characters. For example, a character who is a compulsive liar may struggle with building trust with others, while a character who is an animal hater may have trouble working with characters who have animal companions. Whether you choose to focus on the more harmless or more engaging quirks, incorporating these small behaviors into your character can greatly enhance your role-playing experience.</p>

For this reason, we suggest that players consider assigning these disorders to non-player characters, adding depth and complexity to the game world. It's important to note that the list provided is not exhaustive and only offers brief descriptions. Nevertheless, these disorders can also serve as inspiration for creating realistic and terrifying curses or divine punishments.</p>

<h2 id="topics-of-conversation">Topics of Conversation</h2>
<p>One helpful way to bring depth to your character is to determine what they like to talk about in casual social situations. People are naturally inclined to talk about things they are skilled in or have a personal interest in, and this is an easy way to help flesh out your character. By examining your character's skills, hobbies, training, and background, you can start to determine what topics they might be passionate about. This information can be used to create a more complete picture of who your character is and how they interact with others in social situations. By giving your character a few key topics they like to discuss, you can help bring them to life and make them more memorable to other players.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the character's personality is a crucial aspect in role-playing games and helps to bring the character to life. This chapter has covered a range of fields that allow players to flesh out their characters, including alignment, morality, values, beliefs, religion and spirituality, and quirks. These fields provide a comprehensive and nuanced view of the character's personality, allowing players to bring depth and dimension to their characters. By taking the time to fill out these fields, players can create truly unique and engaging characters that will bring their stories to life. Whether playing a heroic warrior or a cunning rogue, these fields help players to truly embody their characters and bring the world of the game to life.</p>
<h1 id="spirituality-and-religion">Spirituality and Religion</h1>
<p><img alt="Image1" src="./images/religion01.svg" /></p>
<p>In the world of role-playing games, it's important to consider the spirituality and religious beliefs of a character. The Spirituality Sheet is an integral part of character creation and is designed to help players define their character's connection to the spiritual and religious aspects of the game world. This chapter will detail the mechanics behind the Spirituality Sheet, including the options available for defining the strength of a character's belief or association with a religious system, as well as any relevant traits and skills that may impact the character's spirituality and religious beliefs. Whether playing as a devout follower of a particular faith or a non-believer, the Spirituality Sheet will help players bring their character to life and create a more immersive role-playing experience.</p>
<h2 id="adherence">Adherence</h2>
<p>The "Adherence" field on the character sheet represents the strength of the character's belief or association with a particular religious or spiritual system. The options for this field range from non-believer to orthodox adherent, providing a spectrum of beliefs that a character can possess. The non-believer is someone who does not hold any belief in a higher power, whereas an agnostic is someone who is uncertain about the existence of a higher power. On the other hand, a casual adherent is someone who holds a loose connection to their religious or spiritual beliefs, and an orthodox adherent is someone who strictly follows the teachings and practices of their chosen system. This mechanic helps to further flesh out the character and their motivations, and provides a lens through which the character may view the world around them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Non-believer</li>
<li>Agnostic</li>
<li>Casual adherent</li>
<li>Orthodox adherent</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="tolerance">Tolerance</h2>
<p>This field reflects the character's willingness to accept differences of belief in others. In determining the level of tolerance, there are three options available for the player to choose from: Inclusive, Tolerant, or Intolerant. The level of tolerance selected will affect how the character interacts with people of different beliefs and religions in the game world.</p>
<ol>
<li>Inclusive</li>
<li>Tolerant</li>
<li>Intolerant</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Image1" src="./images/religion03.svg" /></p>
<h2 id="religious-demeanor">Religious Demeanor</h2>
<p>The field "RELIGIOUS DEMEANOR" on the character sheet aims to capture how your character tends to act in regards to religious beliefs. To reflect this, the player will be presented with three different fields to fill out. The first field is "Expression of beliefs" and asks the player to decide on the frequency at which their character expresses their beliefs. The options range from "None", "Occasional", to "Constant". The next field is "Converting others", which asks the player to choose the level of effort the character puts into converting others to their beliefs. The choices here are "Never", "Casual", and "Aggressive". Finally, the "Attitude" field asks the player to choose the general approach the character takes towards religion and religious beliefs. The options for this field range from the irreverent "Irreverent" to the devout "Ecstatic". By filling out these fields, the player can gain a deeper understanding of their character's relationship to religion and spirituality.</p>

<h2 id="religious-association">Religious association</h2>
<p>The "Religious Association" field in the character sheet is an important aspect of a character's spirituality. This field indicates the character's affiliation, or lack thereof, with a religious organization or belief system. There are a range of options available, including Church, Cult, Fellowship, Solitary, and Indigenous, each with its own unique meaning and characteristics.</p>
<p>A Church is a well-established, hierarchical religious organization, typically with a set of beliefs and practices that are followed by its members. A Cult is a smaller group attached to a single charismatic leader, who may have unique or unconventional beliefs. A Fellowship is a small, informal religious group that lacks formal organization and a charismatic leader. Solitary is for characters who either have unique beliefs or choose not to affiliate with others, and Indigenous refers to religious traditions within a cultural group, such as a family or village.</p>
<p>Having an understanding of a character's religious association can provide insight into their beliefs, values, and motivations, and can also add depth to their relationships with other characters. This field can also play a role in the story, as it may impact the character's actions and decisions, as well as influence how they are perceived by others.</p>

<p>In Eidos, the combat is based on the ideas presented in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o5vWmoS3KU&amp;ab_channel=SimplyWyvern">video</a>. Basicly the combat needs to be a part of the narrative, not a mini-game that creates transitions in the game. So there is nothing of  initiative rolls nor anything like that. In the world of Eidos, combat is a dynamic and immersive experience that forms an integral part of the gameplay. The combat system in Eidos is meticulously crafted to simulate realistic combat scenarios, with mechanics that emphasize tactical decision-making and narrative engagement.</p>
<h2 id="turn-structure">Turn Structure</h2>
<p>Combat in Eidos follows a fluid turn structure, allowing for seamless interaction between players and the game master. Unlike traditional turn-based systems, Eidos prioritizes moment-to-moment decision-making, where players and the GM exchange actions and reactions in real-time. This approach enhances the narrative flow of combat scenes, fostering a sense of urgency and immersion.</p>
<h2 id="conflic-resolution">Conflic Resolution</h2>
<p>Conflict resolution in Eidos is resolved through a combination of dice rolls and narrative storytelling. Players utilize a 2 20d roll to determine the outcome of their actions, with results influenced by their character's skills, abilities, and environmental factors. The DM adjudicates conflicts based on the narrative context, ensuring that combat encounters remain dynamic and unpredictable. </p>

<h3 id="fire">Fire</h3>
<p>Fire is a potent force on the battlefield, capable of causing devastating injuries and leaving lasting scars. Whether from a raging inferno or a targeted spell, fire damage can result in a variety of effects, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Burns</em>: Characters may suffer from first-degree burns, causing pain and discomfort but relatively minor damage. More severe burns, such as second or third-degree burns, can lead to blistering, tissue damage, and long-term complications.</li>
<li><em>Smoke Inhalation</em>: In addition to direct flame exposure, individuals caught in fires may inhale smoke, leading to respiratory issues, coughing, and reduced lung function.</li>
<li><em>Environmental Hazards</em>: Fires can spread rapidly, creating hazardous conditions such as collapsing structures, intense heat, and limited visibility.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="acid">Acid</h3>
<p>Acid poses a different set of challenges, corroding flesh, armor, and equipment with its caustic properties. When subjected to acid attacks, characters must contend with the following hazards:</p>
<p><strong>Types of Acid Damage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Corrosive Burns</em>: Acid eats away at organic and inorganic materials alike, causing painful burns and potentially permanent damage to skin, clothing, and gear.</li>
<li><em>Armor Degradation</em>: Protective armor may suffer from corrosion, compromising its integrity and reducing its effectiveness in defending against future attacks.</li>
<li><em>Environmental Contamination</em>: Pools of acid or acidic fumes can create hazardous environments, posing risks to both health and equipment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="poison">Poison</h3>
<p>Poison introduces a stealthy and insidious threat to adventurers, lurking in traps, tainted food, or the fangs of venomous creatures. Unlike conventional damage, poison affects its victims over time, gradually weakening their bodies and impairing their abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Poison</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Contact Poison</em>: Applied to weapons or surfaces, contact poisons require physical contact to take effect, such as through a poisoned blade or a booby-trapped object.</li>
<li><em>Ingested Poison</em>: Consumed through food or drink, ingested poisons target the digestive system, leading to nausea, vomiting, and systemic damage.</li>
<li><em>Inhaled Poison</em>: Released as gas or vapor, inhaled poisons affect the respiratory system, causing coughing, difficulty breathing, and potentially lethal asphyxiation.</li>
<li><em>Injected Poison</em>: Delivered via puncture wounds, injected poisons are typically associated with venomous creatures, such as snakes or spiders, and can induce paralysis, organ failure, or death.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="instant-death-and-recovery">Instant Death and Recovery</h3>
<p>In some instances, the outcome of an attack can lead to instant death if the damage dealt is significant enough. Eidos doesn't shy away from the gravity of battle.
For non-fatal injuries, a period of recovery follows. Players who emerge victorious or disengage from the conflict can recuperate over time. The aftermath of combat may leave scars or lingering effects, adding depth to your character's journey.</p>
<p>The aftermath of combat extends beyond the battlefield. Players who survive are left to recover from their wounds, with lasting scars as tokens of their trials. The scars serve as reminders of battles fought, adding layers of realism and immersion to the world of Eidos.
As you continue your exploration of this system, embrace the intricate interplay of choice, strategy, and chance that defines Eidos' unique combat and conflict resolution mechanics.</p>
