In the realm of tabletop role-playing games, Eidos stands as a unique and innovative addition to the genre. Rooted in open-source principles, this game is designed to be both immersive and accessible...

The character creation process in Eidos is a deep and engaging experience, allowing players to build their characters from the ground up. With character sheets devoted to personality, religion, physical description, background, clothing, equipment, and skills, players have the tools to create a truly unique and memorable character.

The combat system in Eidos is designed to be immersive and engaging, with mechanics that are designed to create dynamic and exciting combat scenes. The game's mechanics are based on classic combat narratives, and the system strives to be a simulation of combat rather than simply a turn-based dice-rolling game. The standard rules are designed to be played in a pre-modern low-fantasy setting, but the game is easily adaptable to other role-playing scenarios.

This rulebook is divided into six chapters, each of which covers a different aspect of the game. Chapter 1: Character Creation provides a detailed guide to creating your character, including sections on personality, religion, physical description, background, clothing, equipment, and skills. Chapter 2: Combat and Combat Resolution covers the mechanics of combat in Eidos, including basic combat mechanics, ability checks, skills, tactical maneuvering, environmental interaction, morale, reinforcements, ranged combat, unarmed combat, weapon mechanics, grappling, healing, shields and armor, mounted combat, naval combat, aerial combat, siege weapons, traps, stealth, mass combat, and death and dying.

Chapter 3: Survival Mechanics covers the mechanics of survival in Eidos, including food and water requirements, shelter, scavenging, travel, and exploration. Chapter 4: Character Injuries and Health provides a comprehensive guide to character injuries and health, including damage and wound mechanics, healing and recovery, status effects, and advanced injuries and trauma.

\subsection{\textbf{Primary Motivators}}

The first step in crafting a character's personality is selecting their primary and secondary motivators. These motivations serve as the driving force behind a character's actions and decisions, shaping the narrative of their journey. The primary motivator is particularly important, as it acts as the primary catalyst for a character's backstory and personality. It is the underlying theme of a character's motivations, guiding their behavior and propelling them forward.

When choosing these motivations, it's important to consider what your character wants most in the world. Is it wealth, power, love, revenge, or something else? By focusing on these motivations, players can ensure that their character's actions feel authentic and grounded in their personal desires. Whether facing challenges in combat or navigating complex social situations, characters driven by strong motivators will always have a clear direction and purpose.

\subsection{\textbf{Dispositions}}

Disposition is an important aspect of character creation that provides depth and dimension to your character's personality. It allows you to understand how your character is likely to react emotionally to different situations, as well as how they appear to others. This trait helps you create a believable and relatable character, giving them an emotional landscape that makes sense within the context of the story.

When determining your character's emotional disposition, it is important to keep in mind that it is not necessarily limiting. It simply provides a baseline for how your character is likely to feel at any given moment. A character with a predominantly cheerful disposition may still experience moments of sadness, anger, or anxiety, but they will be more likely to return to their cheerful state after those moments have passed.

It is also important to note that emotional disposition should not be equated with alignment. A character's disposition can exist independently of their moral or ethical alignment, and it is possible for a character to be joyfully evil or angrily good. Understanding your character's disposition will help you make decisions about their emotional reactions, but it is just one aspect of the complex and multifaceted personality that you are creating.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Joyful
    \item Anxious
    \item Melancholy
    \item Curious
    \item Calm
    \item Angry
    \item Contemptuous
    \item Excited
    \item Apathetic
    \item Ashamed
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\textbf{Moodiness}}

Moodiness is an important aspect of a character's personality and can greatly impact their behavior in different situations. A character who is labile, or quick to experience intense emotions, is likely to react strongly to the events happening around them. This can make them appear impulsive and prone to outbursts, but it can also add a level of excitement and unpredictability to their actions. On the other hand, a phlegmatic character, who is psychologically consistent and moderate, is likely to maintain their composure in even the most trying of situations. This calm demeanor can give them a sense of stability and reliability, but it can also make them appear uninterested or indifferent to the world around them.

It is important to note that both moodiness traits have their own strengths and weaknesses, and they can greatly impact a character's relationships with other characters. For example, a labile character may be prone to jealousy or resentment, while a phlegmatic character may struggle with expressing their emotions effectively. Choosing the right moodiness trait for your character can help you build a more complete and well-rounded personality.

Ultimately, the key to making a character's moodiness work for them is understanding the underlying motivations and dispositions that drive their behavior. Whether your character is quick to experience intense emotions or stays calm and collected in the face of adversity, the key is to make sure that their moodiness feels true to who they are as a character. By incorporating moodiness into your character's personality, you can add depth and richness to your role-playing experience and help bring your character to life on the tabletop.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Labile
    \item Even-tempered
    \item Phlegmatic
\end{enumerate}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/personality03.pdf}
    % \caption{Inline Example Image}
\end{figure}

\subsection{\textbf{Outlook}}

The concept of outlook is an important aspect of character creation as it defines the basic worldview of a character and helps determine their overall view of the world around them. This trait can greatly influence the choices that a character makes and the way they interact with others. A character with a positive outlook is likely to see the good in people and situations, while a character with a negative outlook is likely to be more skeptical and pessimistic. Understanding a character's outlook is key to understanding their motivations and how they may react in different situations. It is important to note that a character's outlook does not dictate their alignment, as a character can have a positive outlook but still make morally questionable decisions. This trait helps to add depth and complexity to a character, making them feel more real and unique.

\begin{description}
    \item[Optimistic] An optimistic outlook is characterized by idealism and confidence. Individuals with this outlook tend to be trusting and hopeful, often viewing situations with an upbeat attitude and a positive expectation for outcomes.
    \item[Pessimistic] A pessimistic outlook is often marked by cynicism and a bleak perspective. Those with this outlook may be distrustful and foreboding, expecting negative outcomes and sometimes feeling resigned to unfavorable situations.
    \item[Realistic] A realistic outlook is grounded in practicality and balance. Realistic individuals approach situations pragmatically, focusing on what is achievable and maintaining a level-headed perspective.
\end{description}

\subsection{\textbf{Integrity}}

Integrity refers to the values that guide a character's behavior in work and social interactions. When creating a character, players can choose between two options that embody different qualities and tendencies. The first option is "Conscientious", which represents being industrious, honest, responsible, meticulous, and pragmatic. On the other hand, the second option is "Unscrupulous", which embodies being lazy, deceitful, unreliable, manipulative, slipshod, and impractical. These two options serve as a starting point for players to develop their character's personality and decision-making. The choice of integrity will play a crucial role in determining a character's motivations and actions, influencing the character's interactions with others and the events of the story.

\begin{description}
    \item[Conscientious] The individual is industrious, honest, responsible, meticulous, and pragmatic.
    \item[Unscrupulous] The individual is lazy, deceitful, unreliable, manipulative, slipshod, and impractical.
\end{description}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/personality04.pdf}
    % \caption{Inline Example Image}
\end{figure}

\subsection{\textbf{Impulsiveness}}

The next aspect of character creation to consider is impulsiveness. This trait refers to a character's ability to regulate their thoughts and actions. Players must choose between two options: controlled or spontaneous. A controlled character is deliberate, focused, steady, and thoughtful. They carefully consider their decisions and think before they act. On the other hand, a spontaneous character is capricious, flighty, hyperactive, and rash. They are quick to act without thinking through the consequences of their actions. It's important to consider impulsiveness as it can greatly impact the way a character approaches situations and reacts to stimuli. A controlled character may be more reliable and level-headed, while a spontaneous character may be more unpredictable and exciting. Ultimately, the choice of impulsiveness helps to round out a character's personality and inform their behavior.

\begin{description}
    \item[Controlled] The individual is deliberate, focused, steady, and thoughtful in their actions.
    \item[Spontaneous] The individual tends to be capricious, flighty, hyperactive, and rash in their behavior.
\end{description}

\subsection{\textbf{Boldness}}

When it comes to creating a character's personality, it is important to consider their boldness, or willingness to face danger and enter into battle. This trait can greatly impact how a character approaches conflict and adversity, and can inform their actions and decisions in high-pressure situations. There are two main options for this characteristic: intrepid and cautious.

Intrepid characters are daring, reckless, and valorous. They have a confident demeanor and are not easily intimidated by danger. They are known for their bravery and audacity in the face of adversity, and are often seen as leaders in combat situations. On the other hand, cautious characters are timid, paranoid, and vigilant. They are nervous and tentative in the face of danger, preferring to assess the situation before making a move. They are not as quick to jump into action, but their carefulness can often lead to a more strategic approach to conflict.

\begin{description}
    \item[Intrepid] The individual is daring, reckless, valorous, dauntless, audacious, and confident.
    \item[Cautious] The individual is timid, paranoid, vigilant, nervous, and tentative in their actions.
\end{description}

\end{figure}

\subsection{\textbf{Agreeableness}}

The sub-topic of "Agreeableness" deals with a character's overall attitude towards others and their ability to handle interpersonal conflicts and new situations. This trait is particularly important in shaping a character's behavior in social interactions and their ability to navigate challenging circumstances. A character who is described as "Agreeable" is warm, empathetic, and open-minded, possessing qualities such as tolerance, forgiveness, and adaptability. On the other hand, a character who is described as "Disagreeable" is cold and rigid, possessing traits such as tension, intractability, and narrow-mindedness. Understanding a character's level of agreeableness can give insight into how they are likely to respond in social and interpersonal situations.

\begin{description}
    \item[Agreeable] The individual is warm, empathetic, tolerant, forgiving, open-minded, adaptable, and altruistic.
    \item[Disagreeable] The individual is cold, rigid, tense, intractable, narrow-minded, cantankerous, and stingy.
\end{description}

\subsection{\textbf{Interactivity}}

The next sub-topic in character creation is Interactivity, which deals with the way your character interacts with others. This aspect of personality is crucial in shaping the character's social relationships and determining how they engage with the world around them. The table of choices in Interactivity includes two options: Engaging and Reserved. An Engaging character is often talkative, candid, and touchy, while a Reserved character is usually shy, preferring to keep to themselves and be more reserved in their interactions. Understanding this aspect of your character will greatly enhance the depth of your role-playing experience and allow you to build compelling, engaging stories.

\begin{description}
    \item[Engaging] The individual is talkative, candid, entertaining, and touchy.
    \item[Reserved] The individual is shy, a loner, taciturn, evasive, and cryptic.
\end{description}

\subsection{\textbf{Conformity}}

Conformity is an important aspect of a character's personality, determining their relationship with cultural norms and societal expectations. A character who is conventional is likely to follow orthodox beliefs and practices, be formal in their demeanor, and adhere to mainstream customs. On the other hand, a character who is heterodox may be rebellious in nature, have a creative and artistic streak, and may be known for their freethinking and exotic choices. Understanding a character's conformity can give insight into how they view and interact with the world around them.

\begin{description}
    \item[Conventional] The individual is orthodox, formal, down-to-earth, mainstream, and traditional.
    \item[Heterodox] The individual is rebellious, arty, shocking, freethinking, and exotic.
\end{description}

\subsection{\textbf{Quirks, Habits, and Oddities}}

To help bring your character to life and add depth to gameplay, consider incorporating small quirks, habits, and oddities into their personality. These unique behavioral characteristics can range from relatively harmless habits, such as humming or lip biting, to more engaging and potentially entertaining quirks such as exhibitionism or sleepwalking. By adding these small but meaningful details to your character, you can bring them to life in a way that sets them apart from the rest of the party.

These quirks, habits, and oddities can offer a multitude of role-playing opportunities. They can help flesh out a character's backstory, provide unique challenges or benefits during gameplay, and even influence the way they interact with other characters. For example, a character who is a compulsive liar may struggle with building trust with others, while a character who is an animal hater may have trouble working with characters who have animal companions. Whether you choose to focus on the more harmless or more engaging quirks, incorporating these small behaviors into your character can greatly enhance your role-playing experience.

\subsection{\textbf{Sense of Humor}}

Sense of Humor is an important aspect of a character's personality and can be used to show their humor preferences and how they might react in different situations. It ranges from crude humor to dry wit and includes various styles such as slapstick, jokey, cynical, prankster, mean-spirited, gleeful, and surreal. By selecting one of these options, you can help to define your character's sense of humor and how they might react in different situations. Having a strong sense of humor can also be a way for your character to diffuse tense situations, and can be used to show their lighter side. Ultimately, your character's sense of humor is a tool that you can use to further develop their personality and bring them to life in your storytelling.

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0.4em]

    \item Surreal
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\textbf{Mental Disorders}}

In this RPG system, we aim to provide an accurate representation of human mental and emotional disorders. While we understand that not all players may want their character to struggle with such issues, it does present an opportunity for unique and interesting role-play. For this reason, we suggest that players consider assigning these disorders to non-player characters, adding depth and complexity to the game world.

\end{center}

In the world of role-playing games, it's important to consider the spirituality and religious beliefs of a character. The Spirituality Sheet is an integral part of character creation and is designed to help players define their character's connection to the spiritual and religious aspects of the game world. This chapter will detail the mechanics behind the Spirituality Sheet, including the options available for defining the strength of a character's belief or association with a religious system, as well as any relevant traits and skills that may impact the character's spirituality and religious beliefs. Whether playing as a devout follower of a particular faith or a non-believer, the Spirituality Sheet will help players bring their character to life and create a more immersive role-playing experience.

\subsection{\textbf{Adherence}}

The "Adherence" field on the character sheet represents the strength of the character's belief or association with a particular religious or spiritual system. The options for this field range from non-believer to orthodox adherent, providing a spectrum of beliefs that a character can possess. The non-believer is someone who does not hold any belief in a higher power, whereas an agnostic is someone who is uncertain about the existence of a higher power. On the other hand, a casual adherent is someone who holds a loose connection to their religious or spiritual beliefs, and an orthodox adherent is someone who strictly follows the teachings and practices of their chosen system. This mechanic helps to further flesh out the character and their motivations, and provides a lens through which the character may view the world around them.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Non-believer
    \item Agnostic
    \item Casual adherent
    \item Orthodox adherent
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\textbf{Tolerance}}

This field reflects the character's willingness to accept differences of belief in others. In determining the level of tolerance, there are three options available for the player to choose from: Inclusive, Tolerant, or Intolerant. The level of tolerance selected will affect how the character interacts with people of different beliefs and religions in the game world.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Inclusive
    \item Tolerant
    \item Intolerant
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\textbf{Religious Demeanor}}

The field "RELIGIOUS DEMEANOR" on the character sheet aims to capture how your character tends to act in regards to religious beliefs. To reflect this, the player will be presented with three different fields to fill out. The first field is "Expression of beliefs" and asks the player to decide on the frequency at which their character expresses their beliefs. The options range from "None", "Occasional", to "Constant". The next field is "Converting others", which asks the player to choose the level of effort the character puts into converting others to their beliefs. The choices here are "Never", "Casual", and "Aggressive". Finally, the "Attitude" field asks the player to choose the general approach the character takes towards religion and religious beliefs. The options for this field range from the irreverent "Irreverent" to the devout "Ecstatic". By filling out these fields, the player can gain a deeper understanding of their character's relationship to religion and spirituality.

\textbf{Expressions of Beliefs:} The individual may express their beliefs in different ways. They could be a \textbf{\textit{None}}, meaning they do not express their beliefs outwardly. They could be \textbf{\textit{Occasional}}, meaning they express their beliefs casually or sporadically. Or, they could be \textbf{\textit{Constant}}, meaning they frequently and openly express their beliefs.

\textbf{Approach to Converting Others:} When it comes to converting others, individuals may approach this in varying degrees. They might be \textbf{\textit{Never}} interested in converting others to their beliefs, meaning they have no desire to do so. They might be \textbf{\textit{Casual}}, where they casually discuss their beliefs with others without the intent to convert them. Or, they might be \textbf{\textit{Aggressive}}, meaning they actively try to convert others, sometimes with strong persuasion.

\textbf{Attitudes Toward Beliefs:} Individuals also differ in how they approach their own beliefs. They may be \textbf{\textit{Irreverent}}, meaning they treat their beliefs with little seriousness or respect. They could be \textbf{\textit{Fearful}}, having a fearful or cautious approach toward their beliefs. They might be \textbf{\textit{Judgmental}}, meaning they are critical of others’ beliefs compared to their own. Alternatively, they may be \textbf{\textit{Humble}}, holding a modest and respectful view of their beliefs, or \textbf{\textit{Ecstatic}}, experiencing intense joy and enthusiasm in their beliefs.

\subsection{\textbf{Religious association}}

The "Religious Association" field in the character sheet is an important aspect of a character's spirituality. This field indicates the character's affiliation, or lack thereof, with a religious organization or belief system. There are a range of options available, including Church, Cult, Fellowship, Solitary, and Indigenous, each with its own unique meaning and characteristics.

A Church is a well-established, hierarchical religious organization, typically with a set of beliefs and practices that are followed by its members. A Cult is a smaller group attached to a single charismatic leader, who may have unique or unconventional beliefs. A Fellowship is a small, informal religious group that lacks formal organization and a charismatic leader. Solitary is for characters who either have unique beliefs or choose not to affiliate with others, and Indigenous refers to religious traditions within a cultural group, such as a family or village.

Having an understanding of a character's religious association can provide insight into their beliefs, values, and motivations, and can also add depth to their relationships with other characters. This field can also play a role in the story, as it may impact the character's actions and decisions, as well as influence how they are perceived by others.

% Chapter 5 - Background
% ###################################################################################################
\chapter{Background}

The background section is designed to help players craft a rich and meaningful history for their characters. This section offers prompts to guide the player through the process of writing a cohesive backstory that connects the character's past with the decisions reflected on the character sheet (such as religion, scars, or personality traits). Below are questions that the player can use to generate a detailed narrative. Each answer should be written as part of a continuous text, creating a personal story for the character.

\subsection*{Birth and Early Life}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Where was your character born? \\
    \textit{Example: ``[Character Name] was born in [City Name], a small village nestled between mountains.''}
    
    \item What was their family situation like (parents, siblings, guardians)?
    \item Did they grow up in wealth or poverty?
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Education and Early Influences}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What was their education like? Were they formally educated, self-taught, or completely untrained?
    \item Who were the people that had the most significant influence on them growing up?
    \item Did the character have a role model or mentor?
    \item What major events shaped the character’s worldview (war, loss, triumph)?
    \item Have they ever made a life-changing decision they regret or are proud of?
    \item Why did they adopt their religious or philosophical beliefs? What experiences led to this?
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Appearance and Scars}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Are there any visible signs of past events on their body (scars, tattoos, piercings)?
    \item If so, what is the story behind each of these? \\
    \textit{Example: ``A long scar runs down his arm, a reminder of his first failed duel.''}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Relationships and Conflicts}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What relationships have shaped them (romantic, familial, friendships, rivalries)?
    \item Do they have any enemies or unresolved grudges?
    \item How do they handle conflicts and disagreements?
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Occupation and Skills}

\begin{itemize}
    \item How did the character acquire their skills?
    \item What jobs or roles did they perform throughout their life?
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Motivations and Goals}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What drives your character today? Do they have a primary goal or aspiration?
    \item Are they seeking redemption, revenge, recognition, or something else?
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Secrets and Fears}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Does the character have any secrets? If so, what are they hiding and why?
    \item What are their greatest fears?
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Encouraging Narrative Justification}

Players are encouraged to link their background story with other aspects of the character sheet, such as personality traits, religion, or scars. For example, if the character's religion reflects a personal experience, this should be included in the backstory. If they bear a particular scar, the background should explain how they got it and what impact it had on their life.

\subsection*{Player Tips}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Focus on Motivation:} Every event in the character's life should build towards understanding what drives them today.
    \item \textbf{Leave Room for Growth:} Avoid writing a ``perfect'' character—leave flaws and conflicts unresolved to make space for in-game development.
    \item \textbf{Collaborate with the Game Master:} Share your background with the GM so they can weave elements into the campaign.
\end{itemize}

This approach will give players flexibility while offering enough structure to create meaningful and coherent character histories. The questions act as prompts to encourage creative storytelling while also ensuring that important character elements are tied together.

% Chapter 6 - Clothing and Equipment
% ###################################################################################################
\chapter{Clothing and Equipment}

In Eidos, what characters wear is not just a matter of protection—it reflects their background, status, and the role they play in the world. A noble dressed in ceremonial robes conveys a different message than a seasoned warrior in battle-worn mail. Clothing and armor help shape the narrative, affect how NPCs react, and influence a character’s abilities within the game. Players are encouraged to select outfits that align with their character’s role, culture, and personal history.

Each character will have at least two sets of clothing: one primary and one secondary. These sets represent their lifestyle and choices. For example, a merchant might carry both casual clothing for travel and finer garments for negotiations, while a warrior may have ceremonial armor for formal events and heavier armor for battle. However, the use of mismatched or inappropriate gear—for example, wearing armor in court or dressing poorly for a formal audience—can impact interactions and story outcomes.

This system emphasizes that clothing and armor aren’t just mechanical choices but integral to role-playing. What characters wear shapes their place in the world, reflects their status, and influences how others perceive them. The chosen attire should make sense given their station, environment, and circumstances.

\section{Armor Levels and Narrative Effects}

Each set of clothing or armor falls into one of four levels: No Armor, Lightly Armored, Armored, or Heavily Armored. Each level brings specific benefits and limitations, encouraging players to think strategically about what to wear in different scenarios.

\subsection*{No Armor}

\textbf{Description:} Simple clothes with no protective qualities—robes, tunics, or travel gear.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pros:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Maximum freedom of movement and agility.
        \item Ideal for stealth and blending into crowds.
        \item No exhaustion from prolonged wear.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cons:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Vulnerable to all forms of physical attacks.
        \item Requires reliance on clever tactics or diplomacy in dangerous situations.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Lightly Armored}

\textbf{Description:} Leather armor, padded jackets, or chainmail worn under clothing—suitable for agile fighters or scouts.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pros:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Offers moderate protection without sacrificing much agility.
        \item Useful for roles that demand both defense and speed.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cons:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Can’t stop heavier strikes or blunt force.
        \item Mild discomfort when worn for long periods, especially in hot climates.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Armored}

\textbf{Description:} Chainmail or partial plate—common for soldiers or knights who need balanced defense and movement.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pros:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Protects against slashing and piercing attacks.
        \item Intimidating to opponents and suitable for frontline combat.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cons:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Noisy and limits stealth attempts.
        \item Slows down the wearer during long chases or escapes.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Heavily Armored}

\textbf{Description:} Full plate armor or reinforced chainmail, designed for the battlefield.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pros:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Provides the highest level of protection, resisting most physical damage.
        \item Creates an overwhelming presence, discouraging enemies.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cons:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Severely limits movement—running, climbing, or swimming is nearly impossible.
        \item Causes exhaustion if worn for too long or in the wrong environment.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Changing and Using Armor Narratively}

The choice of clothing and armor is not permanent—characters can change between their sets as needed, but doing so takes time and planning. For instance:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Swapping from travel clothes to ceremonial robes before entering a royal audience can influence the outcome of a negotiation.
    \item Switching from light to heavy armor before a siege offers protection but limits agility.
    \item Choosing not to wear armor at all during a diplomatic event signals trust but also leaves the character vulnerable if things go wrong.
\end{itemize}

Armor not only defines how characters look but also shapes the gameplay. A heavily armored warrior might struggle to infiltrate a guarded mansion, while a rogue in light clothing could breeze through. Each level comes with strengths and weaknesses that push players to think creatively, adapting their equipment to suit the challenges of the story.

\chapter{Conflict Mechanics}

\end{center}

In \textit{Eidos}, the combat is based on the ideas presented in this \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o5vWmoS3KU&ab_channel=SimplyWyvern}{video}. Basically, the combat needs to be a part of the narrative, not a mini-game that creates transitions in the game. So there is nothing of initiative rolls nor anything like that. In the world of \textit{Eidos}, combat is a dynamic and immersive experience that forms an integral part of the gameplay. The combat system in \textit{Eidos} is meticulously crafted to simulate realistic combat scenarios, with mechanics that emphasize tactical decision-making and narrative engagement.

\section{Turn Structure}

Combat in Eidos follows a fluid turn structure, allowing for seamless interaction between players and the game master. Unlike traditional turn-based systems, Eidos prioritizes moment-to-moment decision-making, where players and the GM exchange actions and reactions in real-time. This approach enhances the narrative flow of combat scenes, fostering a sense of urgency and immersion.

\section{Conflic Resolution}

Conflict resolution in Eidos is resolved through a combination of dice rolls and narrative storytelling. Players utilize a 2 20d roll to determine the outcome of their actions, with results influenced by their character's skills, abilities, and environmental factors. The DM adjudicates conflicts based on the narrative context, ensuring that combat encounters remain dynamic and unpredictable. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Very easy:} Target number 05
    \item \textbf{Easy:} Target number 10
    \item \textbf{Moderate:} Target number 15
    \item \textbf{Difficult:} Target number 20
    \item \textbf{Hard:} Target number 25
    \item \textbf{Very hard:} Target number 30
    \item \textbf{Extremely hard:} Target number 35
    \item \textbf{Nearly impossible:} Target number 39
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/combat02.pdf}
    % \caption{Inline Example Image}
\end{figure}

Each attack's success prompts a roll on a corresponding injury table. For example, an attacker aims for a specific body part like the neck and successfully hits, the player rolls the "Cutting in Neck Damage Table" to determine the outcome. These tables define the consequences, ranging from minor wounds to severe trauma.

\subsection{Types of Injury}

Types of injury include several categories based on the nature of the harm inflicted. \textbf{Cutting} involves damage from sharp-edged weapons, such as swords or knives, which can cause deep lacerations. \textbf{Stabbing} refers to injuries from piercing weapons, like spears or daggers, that penetrate deeply into the body. \textbf{Impact} injuries result from blunt force or crushing attacks, often leading to bruising or broken bones. \textbf{Fire} damage is caused by burns or heat sources, leaving severe burns and potentially long-term tissue damage. \textbf{Acid} injuries come from exposure to corrosive acids or chemicals, which can eat away at skin and muscle. \textbf{Poison} represents harm caused by toxic substances that can weaken or kill through systemic effects. Finally, \textbf{Fall} injuries occur when someone falls from a significant height, often causing fractures, sprains, or other trauma.

\subsection{Injury Places}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Head:} The uppermost part of the body.
    \item \textbf{Torso:} The main part of the body, including the chest.
    \item \textbf{Left Arm:} The left arm and hand.
    \item \textbf{Right Arm:} The right arm and hand.
    \item \textbf{Left Leg:} The left leg and foot.
    \item \textbf{Right Leg:} The right leg and foot.
    \item \textbf{Abdomen:} The area between the chest and pelvis.
    \item \textbf{Back:} The rear part of the torso.
    \item \textbf{Neck:} The part connecting the head to the body.
    \item \textbf{Face:} The front of the head, including facial features.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fire Injuries}

Fire is a potent force on the battlefield, capable of causing devastating injuries and leaving lasting scars. Whether from a raging inferno or a targeted spell, fire damage can result in a variety of effects, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Burns}: Characters may suffer from first-degree burns, causing pain and discomfort but relatively minor damage. More severe burns, such as second or third-degree burns, can lead to blistering, tissue damage, and long-term complications.
    \item \textbf{Smoke Inhalation}: In addition to direct flame exposure, individuals caught in fires may inhale smoke, leading to respiratory issues, coughing, and reduced lung function.
    \item \textbf{Environmental Hazards}: Fires can spread rapidly, creating hazardous conditions such as collapsing structures, intense heat, and limited visibility.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Acid}

Acid poses a different set of challenges, corroding flesh, armor, and equipment with its caustic properties. When subjected to acid attacks, characters must contend with the following hazards:

\textbf{Types of Acid Damage}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Corrosive Burns}: Acid eats away at organic and inorganic materials alike, causing painful burns and potentially permanent damage to skin, clothing, and gear.
    \item \textbf{Armor Degradation}: Protective armor may suffer from corrosion, compromising its integrity and reducing its effectiveness in defending against future attacks.
    \item \textbf{Environmental Contamination}: Pools of acid or acidic fumes can create hazardous environments, posing risks to both health and equipment.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Poison}

Poison introduces a stealthy and insidious threat to adventurers, lurking in traps, tainted food, or the fangs of venomous creatures. Unlike conventional damage, poison affects its victims over time, gradually weakening their bodies and impairing their abilities.

\textbf{Types of Poison}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Contact Poison}: Applied to weapons or surfaces, contact poisons require physical contact to take effect, such as through a poisoned blade or a booby-trapped object.
    \item \textbf{Ingested Poison}: Consumed through food or drink, ingested poisons target the digestive system, leading to nausea, vomiting, and systemic damage.
    \item \textbf{Inhaled Poison}: Released as gas or vapor, inhaled poisons affect the respiratory system, causing coughing, difficulty breathing, and potentially lethal asphyxiation.
    \item \textbf{Injected Poison}: Delivered via puncture wounds, injected poisons are typically associated with venomous creatures, such as snakes or spiders, and can induce paralysis, organ failure, or death.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Instant Death and Recovery}

In some instances, the outcome of an attack can lead to instant death if the damage dealt is significant enough. Eidos doesn't shy away from the gravity of battle.
For non-fatal injuries, a period of recovery follows. Players who emerge victorious or disengage from the conflict can recuperate over time. The aftermath of combat may leave scars or lingering effects, adding depth to your character's journey.

The aftermath of combat extends beyond the battlefield. Players who survive are left to recover from their wounds, with lasting scars as tokens of their trials. The scars serve as reminders of battles fought, adding layers of realism and immersion to the world of Eidos.
As you continue your exploration of this system, embrace the intricate interplay of choice, strategy, and chance that defines Eidos' unique combat and conflict resolution mechanics.

\chapter{Survival Mechanics}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/survival01.pdf}
    % \caption{Inline Example Image}
\end{figure}

Survival in Eidos revolves around the balance between risk and resilience. When characters face environmental challenges, hunger, thirst, or wounds, their effectiveness declines—but these conditions also provide narrative depth, giving the GM and players opportunities to explore moments of hardship and triumph.

\section{Food and Water Requirements}

Survival depends on the characters managing hunger and thirst. These conditions are tracked narratively rather than with numbers. Going without food or water introduces nerfs to skill tests, symbolizing fatigue, confusion, or irritability.

\textbf{Hungry:} -1 to mental rolls (distraction from hunger).

\textbf{Thirsty:} -1 to physical rolls (muscle weakness or slowed reflexes).

After one full day without food or water, these penalties increase to -2. At this stage, the character may exhibit behavioral shifts such as irritability, sluggishness, or hallucinations—elements that drive the narrative. Players must seek sustenance within the story through scavenging, hunting, or trading. Eating and drinking restore the character to normal functionality.

\section{Shelter and Environmental Hazards}

Exposure to extreme weather or dangerous environments gradually wears down a character through Fatigue Points:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{1-2 Points:} Minor exhaustion (no effect).
    \item \textbf{3-4 Points:} -1 to all physical rolls.
    \item \textbf{5+ Points:} Risk of unconsciousness (character must roll 2d20 against a target of 15).
\end{itemize}

To recover, the player must find shelter (a warm camp, dry cave, or safe house). GMs can use these rest moments to introduce story hooks, like meeting NPCs or making discoveries. Shelter also restores 1 Fatigue Point per hour of uninterrupted rest.

\section{Scavenging and Resource Management}

In Eidos, scavenging is an exploratory mechanic driven by narrative. Instead of predefined loot tables, the GM describes environments and players declare their intentions (e.g., “I search the abandoned warehouse for water containers”). Each scavenging action requires a 2d20 roll:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Success:} The player finds useful supplies (food, water, first aid).
    \item \textbf{Partial success:} The item is damaged or in limited supply.
    \item \textbf{Failure:} The player finds nothing or risks a complication (like setting off an alarm or encountering a hostile creature).
\end{itemize}

Resources like food, water, or bandages aren’t counted individually but treated as narrative elements. For example, finding a first aid kit doesn’t guarantee endless healing—it provides one meaningful use within the story.

\section{Status Effects and Debuffs}

Injuries and conditions introduce status effects that evolve with the story. These effects aren’t just penalties—they shape how characters interact with the world. Below are a few common status effects:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fatigued:} -1 to all rolls (can accumulate with hunger/thirst).
    \item \textbf{Infected Wound:} Must succeed in a 2d20 Survival roll every day (Difficulty 15) or the condition worsens.
    \item \textbf{Disoriented:} -2 to mental rolls (due to concussion or exhaustion).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Resolving Status Effects}

These effects persist until addressed in the story. For example, to remove \textbf{Disorientation}, the character might need to sleep or drink water.
