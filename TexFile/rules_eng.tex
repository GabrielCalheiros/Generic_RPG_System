In the realm of tabletop role-playing games, Eidos stands as a unique and innovative addition to the genre. Rooted in open-source principles, this game is designed to be both immersive and accessible...

The character creation process in Eidos is a deep and engaging experience, allowing players to build their characters from the ground up. With character sheets devoted to personality, religion, physical description, background, clothing, equipment, and skills, players have the tools to create a truly unique and memorable character.

The combat system in Eidos is designed to be immersive and engaging, with mechanics that are designed to create dynamic and exciting combat scenes. The game's mechanics are based on classic combat narratives, and the system strives to be a simulation of combat rather than simply a turn-based dice-rolling game. The standard rules are designed to be played in a pre-modern low-fantasy setting, but the game is easily adaptable to other role-playing scenarios.

This rulebook is divided into six chapters, each of which covers a different aspect of the game. Chapter 1: Character Creation provides a detailed guide to creating your character, including sections on personality, religion, physical description, background, clothing, equipment, and skills. Chapter 2: Combat and Combat Resolution covers the mechanics of combat in Eidos, including basic combat mechanics, ability checks, skills, tactical maneuvering, environmental interaction, morale, reinforcements, ranged combat, unarmed combat, weapon mechanics, grappling, healing, shields and armor, mounted combat, naval combat, aerial combat, siege weapons, traps, stealth, mass combat, and death and dying.

Chapter 3: Survival Mechanics covers the mechanics of survival in Eidos, including food and water requirements, shelter, scavenging, travel, and exploration. Chapter 4: Character Injuries and Health provides a comprehensive guide to character injuries and health, including damage and wound mechanics, healing and recovery, status effects, and advanced injuries and trauma.

\subsection{\textbf{Primary Motivators}}

The first step in crafting a character's personality is selecting their primary and secondary motivators. These motivations serve as the driving force behind a character's actions and decisions, shaping the narrative of their journey. The primary motivator is particularly important, as it acts as the primary catalyst for a character's backstory and personality. It is the underlying theme of a character's motivations, guiding their behavior and propelling them forward.

When choosing these motivations, it's important to consider what your character wants most in the world. Is it wealth, power, love, revenge, or something else? By focusing on these motivations, players can ensure that their character's actions feel authentic and grounded in their personal desires. Whether facing challenges in combat or navigating complex social situations, characters driven by strong motivators will always have a clear direction and purpose.

\subsection{\textbf{Dispositions}}

Disposition is an important aspect of character creation that provides depth and dimension to your character's personality. It allows you to understand how your character is likely to react emotionally to different situations, as well as how they appear to others. This trait helps you create a believable and relatable character, giving them an emotional landscape that makes sense within the context of the story.

When determining your character's emotional disposition, it is important to keep in mind that it is not necessarily limiting. It simply provides a baseline for how your character is likely to feel at any given moment. A character with a predominantly cheerful disposition may still experience moments of sadness, anger, or anxiety, but they will be more likely to return to their cheerful state after those moments have passed.

It is also important to note that emotional disposition should not be equated with alignment. A character's disposition can exist independently of their moral or ethical alignment, and it is possible for a character to be joyfully evil or angrily good. Understanding your character's disposition will help you make decisions about their emotional reactions, but it is just one aspect of the complex and multifaceted personality that you are creating.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Joyful
    \item Anxious
    \item Melancholy
    \item Curious
    \item Calm
    \item Angry
    \item Contemptuous
    \item Excited
    \item Apathetic
    \item Ashamed
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\textbf{Moodiness}}

Moodiness is an important aspect of a character's personality and can greatly impact their behavior in different situations. A character who is labile, or quick to experience intense emotions, is likely to react strongly to the events happening around them. This can make them appear impulsive and prone to outbursts, but it can also add a level of excitement and unpredictability to their actions. On the other hand, a phlegmatic character, who is psychologically consistent and moderate, is likely to maintain their composure in even the most trying of situations. This calm demeanor can give them a sense of stability and reliability, but it can also make them appear uninterested or indifferent to the world around them.

It is important to note that both moodiness traits have their own strengths and weaknesses, and they can greatly impact a character's relationships with other characters. For example, a labile character may be prone to jealousy or resentment, while a phlegmatic character may struggle with expressing their emotions effectively. Choosing the right moodiness trait for your character can help you build a more complete and well-rounded personality.

Ultimately, the key to making a character's moodiness work for them is understanding the underlying motivations and dispositions that drive their behavior. Whether your character is quick to experience intense emotions or stays calm and collected in the face of adversity, the key is to make sure that their moodiness feels true to who they are as a character. By incorporating moodiness into your character's personality, you can add depth and richness to your role-playing experience and help bring your character to life on the tabletop.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Labile
    \item Even-tempered
    \item Phlegmatic
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/personality03.pdf}
    % \caption{Inline Example Image}
\end{figure}

\subsection{\textbf{Outlook}}

The concept of outlook is an important aspect of character creation as it defines the basic worldview of a character and helps determine their overall view of the world around them. This trait can greatly influence the choices that a character makes and the way they interact with others. A character with a positive outlook is likely to see the good in people and situations, while a character with a negative outlook is likely to be more skeptical and pessimistic. Understanding a character's outlook is key to understanding their motivations and how they may react in different situations. It is important to note that a character's outlook does not dictate their alignment, as a character can have a positive outlook but still make morally questionable decisions. This trait helps to add depth and complexity to a character, making them feel more real and unique.

\begin{description}
    \item[Optimistic] An optimistic outlook is characterized by idealism and confidence. Individuals with this outlook tend to be trusting and hopeful, often viewing situations with an upbeat attitude and a positive expectation for outcomes.
    \item[Pessimistic] A pessimistic outlook is often marked by cynicism and a bleak perspective. Those with this outlook may be distrustful and foreboding, expecting negative outcomes and sometimes feeling resigned to unfavorable situations.
    \item[Realistic] A realistic outlook is grounded in practicality and balance. Realistic individuals approach situations pragmatically, focusing on what is achievable and maintaining a level-headed perspective.
\end{description}

\subsection{\textbf{Integrity}}

Integrity refers to the values that guide a character's behavior in work and social interactions. When creating a character, players can choose between two options that embody different qualities and tendencies. The first option is "Conscientious", which represents being industrious, honest, responsible, meticulous, and pragmatic. On the other hand, the second option is "Unscrupulous", which embodies being lazy, deceitful, unreliable, manipulative, slipshod, and impractical. These two options serve as a starting point for players to develop their character's personality and decision-making. The choice of integrity will play a crucial role in determining a character's motivations and actions, influencing the character's interactions with others and the events of the story.

\begin{description}
    \item[Conscientious] The individual is industrious, honest, responsible, meticulous, and pragmatic.
    \item[Unscrupulous] The individual is lazy, deceitful, unreliable, manipulative, slipshod, and impractical.
\end{description}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/personality04.pdf}
    % \caption{Inline Example Image}
\end{figure}

\subsection{\textbf{Impulsiveness}}

The next aspect of character creation to consider is impulsiveness. This trait refers to a character's ability to regulate their thoughts and actions. Players must choose between two options: controlled or spontaneous. A controlled character is deliberate, focused, steady, and thoughtful. They carefully consider their decisions and think before they act. On the other hand, a spontaneous character is capricious, flighty, hyperactive, and rash. They are quick to act without thinking through the consequences of their actions. It's important to consider impulsiveness as it can greatly impact the way a character approaches situations and reacts to stimuli. A controlled character may be more reliable and level-headed, while a spontaneous character may be more unpredictable and exciting. Ultimately, the choice of impulsiveness helps to round out a character's personality and inform their behavior.

\begin{description}
    \item[Controlled] The individual is deliberate, focused, steady, and thoughtful in their actions.
    \item[Spontaneous] The individual tends to be capricious, flighty, hyperactive, and rash in their behavior.
\end{description}

\subsection{\textbf{Boldness}}

When it comes to creating a character's personality, it is important to consider their boldness, or willingness to face danger and enter into battle. This trait can greatly impact how a character approaches conflict and adversity, and can inform their actions and decisions in high-pressure situations. There are two main options for this characteristic: intrepid and cautious.

Intrepid characters are daring, reckless, and valorous. They have a confident demeanor and are not easily intimidated by danger. They are known for their bravery and audacity in the face of adversity, and are often seen as leaders in combat situations. On the other hand, cautious characters are timid, paranoid, and vigilant. They are nervous and tentative in the face of danger, preferring to assess the situation before making a move. They are not as quick to jump into action, but their carefulness can often lead to a more strategic approach to conflict.

\begin{description}
    \item[Intrepid] The individual is daring, reckless, valorous, dauntless, audacious, and confident.
    \item[Cautious] The individual is timid, paranoid, vigilant, nervous, and tentative in their actions.
\end{description}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/personality05.pdf}
    % \caption{Inline Example Image}
\end{figure}

\subsection{\textbf{Agreeableness}}

The sub-topic of "Agreeableness" deals with a character's overall attitude towards others and their ability to handle interpersonal conflicts and new situations. This trait is particularly important in shaping a character's behavior in social interactions and their ability to navigate challenging circumstances. A character who is described as "Agreeable" is warm, empathetic, and open-minded, possessing qualities such as tolerance, forgiveness, and adaptability. On the other hand, a character who is described as "Disagreeable" is cold and rigid, possessing traits such as tension, intractability, and narrow-mindedness. Understanding a character's level of agreeableness can give insight into how they are likely to respond in social and interpersonal situations.

\begin{description}
    \item[Agreeable] The individual is warm, empathetic, tolerant, forgiving, open-minded, adaptable, and altruistic.
    \item[Disagreeable] The individual is cold, rigid, tense, intractable, narrow-minded, cantankerous, and stingy.
\end{description}

\subsection{\textbf{Interactivity}}

The next sub-topic in character creation is Interactivity, which deals with the way your character interacts with others. This aspect of personality is crucial in shaping the character's social relationships and determining how they engage with the world around them. The table of choices in Interactivity includes two options: Engaging and Reserved. An Engaging character is often talkative, candid, and touchy, while a Reserved character is usually shy, preferring to keep to themselves and be more reserved in their interactions. Understanding this aspect of your character will greatly enhance the depth of your role-playing experience and allow you to build compelling, engaging stories.

\begin{description}
    \item[Engaging] The individual is talkative, candid, entertaining, and touchy.
    \item[Reserved] The individual is shy, a loner, taciturn, evasive, and cryptic.
\end{description}

\subsection{\textbf{Conformity}}

Conformity is an important aspect of a character's personality, determining their relationship with cultural norms and societal expectations. A character who is conventional is likely to follow orthodox beliefs and practices, be formal in their demeanor, and adhere to mainstream customs. On the other hand, a character who is heterodox may be rebellious in nature, have a creative and artistic streak, and may be known for their freethinking and exotic choices. Understanding a character's conformity can give insight into how they view and interact with the world around them.

\begin{description}
    \item[Conventional] The individual is orthodox, formal, down-to-earth, mainstream, and traditional.
    \item[Heterodox] The individual is rebellious, arty, shocking, freethinking, and exotic.
\end{description}

\subsection{\textbf{Quirks, Habits, and Oddities}}

To help bring your character to life and add depth to gameplay, consider incorporating small quirks, habits, and oddities into their personality. These unique behavioral characteristics can range from relatively harmless habits, such as humming or lip biting, to more engaging and potentially entertaining quirks such as exhibitionism or sleepwalking. By adding these small but meaningful details to your character, you can bring them to life in a way that sets them apart from the rest of the party.

These quirks, habits, and oddities can offer a multitude of role-playing opportunities. They can help flesh out a character's backstory, provide unique challenges or benefits during gameplay, and even influence the way they interact with other characters. For example, a character who is a compulsive liar may struggle with building trust with others, while a character who is an animal hater may have trouble working with characters who have animal companions. Whether you choose to focus on the more harmless or more engaging quirks, incorporating these small behaviors into your character can greatly enhance your role-playing experience.

\subsection{\textbf{Sense of Humor}}

Sense of Humor is an important aspect of a character's personality and can be used to show their humor preferences and how they might react in different situations. It ranges from crude humor to dry wit and includes various styles such as slapstick, jokey, cynical, prankster, mean-spirited, gleeful, and surreal. By selecting one of these options, you can help to define your character's sense of humor and how they might react in different situations. Having a strong sense of humor can also be a way for your character to diffuse tense situations, and can be used to show their lighter side. Ultimately, your character's sense of humor is a tool that you can use to further develop their personality and bring them to life in your storytelling.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Crude
    \item Dry
    \item Slapstick
    \item Jokey
    \item Cynical
    \item Prankster
    \item Mean-spirited
    \item Gleeful
    \item Surreal
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\textbf{Mental Disorders}}

In this RPG system, we aim to provide an accurate representation of human mental and emotional disorders. While we understand that not all players may want their character to struggle with such issues, it does present an opportunity for unique and interesting role-play. For this reason, we suggest that players consider assigning these disorders to non-player characters, adding depth and complexity to the game world. It's important to note that the list provided is not exhaustive and only offers brief descriptions.

\subsection{\textbf{Topics of Conversation}}

One helpful way to bring depth to your character is to determine what they like to talk about in casual social situations. People are naturally inclined to talk about things they are skilled in or have a personal interest in, and this is an easy way to help flesh out your character. By examining your character's skills, hobbies, training, and background, you can start to determine what topics they might be passionate about. This information can be used to create a more complete picture of who your character is and how they interact with others in social situations.

In the world of role-playing games, it's important to consider the spirituality and religious beliefs of a character. The Spirituality Sheet is an integral part of character creation and is designed to help players define their character's connection to the spiritual and religious aspects of the game world. This chapter will detail the mechanics behind the Spirituality Sheet, including the options available for defining the strength of a character's belief or association with a religious system, as well as any relevant traits and skills that may impact the character's spirituality and religious beliefs. Whether playing as a devout follower of a particular faith or a non-believer, the Spirituality Sheet will help players bring their character to life and create a more immersive role-playing experience.

\subsection{\textbf{Adherence}}

The "Adherence" field on the character sheet represents the strength of the character's belief or association with a particular religious or spiritual system. The options for this field range from non-believer to orthodox adherent, providing a spectrum of beliefs that a character can possess. The non-believer is someone who does not hold any belief in a higher power, whereas an agnostic is someone who is uncertain about the existence of a higher power. On the other hand, a casual adherent is someone who holds a loose connection to their religious or spiritual beliefs, and an orthodox adherent is someone who strictly follows the teachings and practices of their chosen system. This mechanic helps to further flesh out the character and their motivations, and provides a lens through which the character may view the world around them.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Non-believer
    \item Agnostic
    \item Casual adherent
    \item Orthodox adherent
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\textbf{Tolerance}}

This field reflects the character's willingness to accept differences of belief in others. In determining the level of tolerance, there are three options available for the player to choose from: Inclusive, Tolerant, or Intolerant. The level of tolerance selected will affect how the character interacts with people of different beliefs and religions in the game world.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Inclusive
    \item Tolerant
    \item Intolerant
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\textbf{Religious Demeanor}}

The field "RELIGIOUS DEMEANOR" on the character sheet aims to capture how your character tends to act in regards to religious beliefs. To reflect this, the player will be presented with three different fields to fill out. The first field is "Expression of beliefs" and asks the player to decide on the frequency at which their character expresses their beliefs. The options range from "None", "Occasional", to "Constant". The next field is "Converting others", which asks the player to choose the level of effort the character puts into converting others to their beliefs. The choices here are "Never", "Casual", and "Aggressive". Finally, the "Attitude" field asks the player to choose the general approach the character takes towards religion and religious beliefs. The options for this field range from the irreverent "Irreverent" to the devout "Ecstatic". By filling out these fields, the player can gain a deeper understanding of their character's relationship to religion and spirituality.

\textbf{Expressions of Beliefs:} The individual may express their beliefs in different ways. They could be a \textbf{\textit{None}}, meaning they do not express their beliefs outwardly. They could be \textbf{\textit{Occasional}}, meaning they express their beliefs casually or sporadically. Or, they could be \textbf{\textit{Constant}}, meaning they frequently and openly express their beliefs.

\textbf{Approach to Converting Others:} When it comes to converting others, individuals may approach this in varying degrees. They might be \textbf{\textit{Never}} interested in converting others to their beliefs, meaning they have no desire to do so. They might be \textbf{\textit{Casual}}, where they casually discuss their beliefs with others without the intent to convert them. Or, they might be \textbf{\textit{Aggressive}}, meaning they actively try to convert others, sometimes with strong persuasion.

\textbf{Attitudes Toward Beliefs:} Individuals also differ in how they approach their own beliefs. They may be \textbf{\textit{Irreverent}}, meaning they treat their beliefs with little seriousness or respect. They could be \textbf{\textit{Fearful}}, having a fearful or cautious approach toward their beliefs. They might be \textbf{\textit{Judgmental}}, meaning they are critical of others’ beliefs compared to their own. Alternatively, they may be \textbf{\textit{Humble}}, holding a modest and respectful view of their beliefs, or \textbf{\textit{Ecstatic}}, experiencing intense joy and enthusiasm in their beliefs.

\subsection{\textbf{Religious association}}

The "Religious Association" field in the character sheet is an important aspect of a character's spirituality. This field indicates the character's affiliation, or lack thereof, with a religious organization or belief system. There are a range of options available, including Church, Cult, Fellowship, Solitary, and Indigenous, each with its own unique meaning and characteristics.

A Church is a well-established, hierarchical religious organization, typically with a set of beliefs and practices that are followed by its members. A Cult is a smaller group attached to a single charismatic leader, who may have unique or unconventional beliefs. A Fellowship is a small, informal religious group that lacks formal organization and a charismatic leader. Solitary is for characters who either have unique beliefs or choose not to affiliate with others, and Indigenous refers to religious traditions within a cultural group, such as a family or village.

Having an understanding of a character's religious association can provide insight into their beliefs, values, and motivations, and can also add depth to their relationships with other characters. This field can also play a role in the story, as it may impact the character's actions and decisions, as well as influence how they are perceived by others.
