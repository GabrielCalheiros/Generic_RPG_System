<body>
    <p>In the world of role-playing games, it's important to consider the spirituality and religious beliefs of a
        character. The Spirituality Sheet is an integral part of character creation and is designed to help players
        define their character's connection to the spiritual and religious aspects of the game world. This chapter will
        detail the mechanics behind the Spirituality Sheet, including the options available for defining the strength of
        a character's belief or association with a religious system, as well as any relevant traits and skills that may
        impact the character's spirituality and religious beliefs. Whether playing as a devout follower of a particular
        faith or a non-believer, the Spirituality Sheet will help players bring their character to life and create a
        more immersive role-playing experience.</p>
    <h4>1.2.1 - Adherence </h4>
    <p>The "Adherence" field on the character sheet represents the strength of the character's belief or association
        with a particular religious or spiritual system. The options for this field range from non-believer to orthodox
        adherent, providing a spectrum of beliefs that a character can possess. The non-believer is someone who does not
        hold any belief in a higher power, whereas an agnostic is someone who is uncertain about the existence of a
        higher power. On the other hand, a casual adherent is someone who holds a loose connection to their religious or
        spiritual beliefs, and an orthodox adherent is someone who strictly follows the teachings and practices of their
        chosen system. This mechanic helps to further flesh out the character and their motivations, and provides a lens
        through which the character may view the world around them.</p>

    <h4>1.2.2 Tolerance</h4>
    <p>This field reflects the character's willingness to accept differences of belief in others. In determining the
        level of tolerance, there are three options available for the player to choose from: Inclusive, Tolerant, or
        Intolerant. The level of tolerance selected will affect how the character interacts with people of different
        beliefs and religions in the game world.</p>

    <h4>1.2.3 Religious Demeanor</h4>

<p>The field "RELIGIOUS DEMEANOR" on the character sheet aims to capture how your character tends to act in regards to religious beliefs. To reflect this, the player will be presented with three different fields to fill out. The first field is "Expression of beliefs" and asks the player to decide on the frequency at which their character expresses their beliefs. The options range from "None", "Occasional", to "Constant". The next field is "Converting others", which asks the player to choose the level of effort the character puts into converting others to their beliefs. The choices here are "Never", "Casual", and "Aggressive". Finally, the "Attitude" field asks the player to choose the general approach the character takes towards religion and religious beliefs. The options for this field range from the irreverent "Irreverent" to the devout "Ecstatic". By filling out these fields, the player can gain a deeper understanding of their character's relationship to religion and spirituality.</p>
