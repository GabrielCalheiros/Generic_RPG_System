<p>In the realm of tabletop role-playing games, <strong>Eidos</strong> stands as a unique and innovative addition to the
	genre. Rooted in the principles of open source development, this game is designed to be both immersive and
	accessible, offering a deep and rich narrative experience that is driven by player choice. The game's mechanics are
	based on a six-sided die, making it accessible to players of all skill levels, and its GPLv3 license ensures that
	the game remains open and freely available to all who wish to play it.</p>
<p><strong>Eidos</strong> takes its name from the ancient Greek concept of the world of ideas, reflecting the game's
	focus on immersive and thought-provoking narratives. This name is a nod to the idea that in role-playing games,
	players have the ability to explore and interact with an imagined world filled with endless possibilities.</p>
<p>The character creation process in <strong>Eidos</strong> is a deep and engaging experience, allowing players to build
	their characters from the ground up. With character sheets devoted to personality, religion, physical description,
	background, clothing, equipment, and skills, players have the tools to create a truly unique and memorable
	character.</p>
<p>The combat system in <strong>Eidos</strong> is designed to be immersive and engaging, with mechanics that are
	designed to create dynamic and exciting combat scenes. The game's mechanics are based on classic combat narratives,
	and the system strives to be a simulation of combat rather than simply a turn-based dice-rolling game. The standard
	rules are designed to be played in a pre-modern low-fantasy setting, but the game is easily adaptable to other
	role-playing scenarios.</p>
<p>This rulebook is divided into six chapters, each of which covers a different aspect of the game. Chapter 1: Character
	Creation provides a detailed guide to creating your character, including sections on personality, religion, physical
	description, background, clothing, equipment, and skills. Chapter 2: Combat and Combat Resolution covers the
	mechanics of combat in <strong>Eidos</strong>, including basic combat mechanics, ability checks, skills, tactical
	maneuvering, environmental interaction, morale, reinforcements, ranged combat, unarmed combat, weapon mechanics,
	grappling, healing, shields and armor, mounted combat, naval combat, aerial combat, siege weapons, traps, stealth,
	mass combat, and death and dying.</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Survival Mechanics covers the mechanics of survival in <strong>Eidos</strong>, including food and water
	requirements, shelter, scavenging, travel, and exploration. Chapter 4: Character Injuries and Health provides a
	comprehensive guide to character injuries and health, including damage and wound mechanics, healing and recovery,
	status effects, and advanced injuries and trauma.</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Game Master Tools provides a guide to running <strong>Eidos</strong> games, including world-building, NPC
	generation, encounters, group dynamics, movement and travel, encounter generation, and campaign management. Chapter
	6: Optional Rules and Variants covers alternative systems for combat, magic, and skills, as well as advanced
	mechanics for character development and progression and rules for playing in different settings and genres.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <strong>Eidos</strong> is an open source tabletop RPG system that offers a unique and engaging
	narrative experience, with mechanics that are designed to create immersive and exciting combat scenes. With its deep
	character creation process, engaging combat mechanics, and comprehensive survival mechanics, <strong>Eidos</strong>
	is a game that offers endless possibilities for players to explore and experience.</p>
