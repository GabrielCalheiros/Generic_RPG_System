    This project aims to be an open source tabletop role-playing game system with a narrative focus. Even though the rules will be made to be as generic as  possible, the initial intent will be to build a low fantasy game, with a punishing combat that will try to carry a realistic feel to it.

<p>
	At the same time, the idea is that every mechanic in the game can be soulved with a simple set of six sided dices, to maximize the reaching and make it a game with as feel prerequisites as possible.
